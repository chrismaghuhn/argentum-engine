/**
 * The top-of-library band — one gather/select/move vocabulary in three layers, and the sentences
 * that lift it.
 *
 * The assertions that earn their place here are the ones about a *field the printer could get wrong*
 * rather than about a sentence parsing. Three of them are the band's whole argument:
 *
 * - the remainder's **order** is carried, so "in a random order" and "in any order" are different
 *   values rather than two spellings of one — the field five hand-written cards were dropping;
 * - "the other" and "the rest" take **disjoint** halves of one value space, so neither the
 *   alternation's order nor its membership can decide which prints;
 * - the impulse anaphor **agrees with the count**, in both directions, and refuses when it does not.
