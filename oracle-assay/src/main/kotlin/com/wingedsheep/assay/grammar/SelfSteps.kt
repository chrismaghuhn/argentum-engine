/**
 * Clauses about the **source** — "it gets +2/+0 until end of turn.", "put it on top of its owner's
 * library.", "sacrifice it unless you discard a land card."
 *
 * Oracle's "it" here is the permanent whose ability this is, which is [EffectTarget.Self] and needs
 * no earlier sentence to introduce it — so unlike [Continuations] these are ordinary clauses that
 * can stand alone. The two anaphors are kept in separate vocabularies precisely because they point
 * at different things: "that creature" is the target the spell already chose, "it" is the source.
 *
 * Almost every card that prints one of these prints it inside a triggered ability ("When this
 * creature dies, put it on top of its owner's library"), and none of these rules knows that:
 * [Triggers] slots [Steps.step] whole, so the clause is the same clause wherever it lands.
 *
 * ### The third anaphor
 *
 * That last sentence holds everywhere but one place. A trigger whose event names a **filter**
 * mentions an object of its own, and English resolves "it" to the most recent mention: "Whenever a
 * Rat you control becomes blocked, **it** gets +2/+0" pumps the *Rat*, not the source. So the same
 * clause denotes [EffectTarget.TriggeringEntity] there and [EffectTarget.Self] everywhere else,
 * while the *name* still denotes the source in both.
 *
 * The vocabulary is therefore written once, as [retargetable], and instantiated per position rather
 * than copied — the members, their models and their fail-closed matches are one piece of code, and
 * only the subject's spelling and the target it denotes move. [Steps.step] takes the source reading
 * and [Steps.triggeredStep] takes both, which is what keeps one printed form per model: in the
 * filtered-trigger cascade the name reads the source and the pronoun reads the triggering entity, so
 * the two surfaces are disjoint and neither can print the other's sentence.
 */
