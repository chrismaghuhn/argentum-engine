/**
 * Number words — the dependency root of the whole pipeline family, because almost every step in it
 * counts something.
 *
 * Oracle text spells small numbers as words ("Draw **two** cards") and writes larger ones as digits,
 * which is why this is separate from [Primitives.cardinal]: that leaf reads the *digits* a keyword
 * parameter uses ("Annihilator 2"), and the two are not interchangeable in either direction. A rule
 * that printed "Draw 2 cards." would round-trip against nothing.
 *
 * The list stops at ten because that is where Oracle's own convention stops — "Draw twenty cards"
 * is not printed, "Draw 20 cards" is. Anything past the end declines, which is the honest answer
 * rather than a number nobody prints.
 *
 * Declared before it is used, per the ordering rule [Primitives] states: object initializers run in
 * declaration order.
