/**
 * Clauses that reach into a graveyard — "Return target creature card from your graveyard to your
 * hand."
 *
 * The first rules whose target is **not on the battlefield**, which is the whole reason they are a
 * file: [Targets.permanent] mints a battlefield `TargetObject` and its inverse refuses anything
 * else, deliberately, so that "destroy target creature" cannot print a script pointing at a
 * graveyard. A graveyard target is the same `TargetObject` with a `zone` and an owner predicate, and
 * both are printed by the noun phrase — "**your** graveyard" is the owner and "from your graveyard"
 * is the zone.
 *
 * The noun ends in "card" rather than naming a permanent, which is Oracle's own distinction: an
 * object in a graveyard is a *card*, not a permanent, and the bare type nouns [Filters] spells are
 * the modifier in front of it. That noun is [Filters.cardNoun] — a whole noun phrase, head word
 * included — and not a `{filter}` slot with the word "card" after it in each template. The
 * difference is what lets a suffix clause exist here at all: "return target creature card **with
 * mana value 3 or less** from your graveyard" attaches behind the head noun, which a sentence-owned
 * "card" left no room for.
 *
 * Its "target card" row is therefore the `Any` row of that vocabulary rather than a rule of its own.
 * It was one until this band; a second rule for the value the general one now prints is the
 * redundant-readings configuration this module gates on.

     *
     * The **untargeted** sibling of [exileAnyCardFromAGraveyard], and the article is the whole
     * difference: "exile **target** card from a graveyard" is a cast-time choice the opponent can
     * respond to and this one is a choice made on resolution, so it declares no
     * `TargetRequirement` at all and collects the candidates itself — gather every graveyard,
     * choose one, move it. Reading the two into one model would be reading a targeting rule off a
     * word Oracle uses to mean the opposite.
     *
     * "A graveyard" is every player's, which the gather says with `Player.Each`; the chooser is the
     * ability's controller, which is `SelectFromCollectionEffect`'s default and what the sentence
     * means with no other player named.
     *
     * The clause is deliberately **not** counted. Oracle prints "a card" here and nothing else —
     * "exile **another** card from a graveyard" (Cemetery Desecrator) is a different sentence with
     * an exclusion this rule has no field for, and it declines rather than losing the word.
     *
     * ### `linkToSource` is not on this line, and is derived by the fold
     *
     * CR 607 makes this ability *linked* to a later one that says "the exiled card", and the SDK
     * carries that fact twice — on the move (`MoveCollectionEffect.linkToSource`) and on the read
     * (`EffectTarget.LinkedExiledCard`). Only the read is printed. So this rule builds the plain
     * move and [CardFragment.deriveExileLinkage] sets the flag when some other line on the same
     * card turns out to read the pile, which is this module's "a value the SDK carries twice is
     * derived, not spelled" applied one scope out: the deriving evidence is on a different line, so
     * the derivation is in the fold rather than in the rule.
