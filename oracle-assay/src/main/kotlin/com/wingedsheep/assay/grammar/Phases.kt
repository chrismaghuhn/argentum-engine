/**
 * "At the beginning of **your upkeep**, …" — the *when* clause of a step trigger, as one vocabulary.
 *
 * ## Why this is a vocabulary and not thirteen rules
 *
 * The SDK has already done the factoring. `dsl.Triggers.<player>.beginningOf(step)` is the one
 * language for "at the beginning of a step", its named constants (`YourUpkeep`, `EachEndStep`,
 * `BeginCombat`, …) are calls to it with every argument frozen, and its own KDoc says to "reach for
 * this factory for any other combination". [Triggers] was calling the frozen constants — thirteen
 * whole-prefix rules, one per printed sentence — so "at the beginning of each opponent's end step"
 * was a rule nobody had written rather than a *pair of words* nobody had slotted. This file is that
 * pair of words: a step noun, a whose-turn layer, and their product.
 *
 * It is the [Library] band's lesson on a `TriggerSpec` rather than on a `Patterns` recipe. Before
 * adding a rule beside an existing one, check whether the two differ only in an argument the facade
 * already takes.
 *
 * ## The whose-turn layer is `Player.possessive`, not a table
 *
 * Every spelling this position needs — "your", "each player's", "each opponent's", "the chosen
 * player's", "enchanted player's" — is already derived by `Player.possessive`, which exists so zone
 * and step descriptions do not each restate it. So [possessiveRule] takes the `Player` and asks the
 * SDK how it is spelled, and the two halves of the rule are one definition. Restating the table here
 * would agree with the SDK exactly until someone added a reference to it.
 *
 * What the layer deliberately does *not* do is range over the whole of `Player`: the members are an
 * explicit list, because `possessive` is total ("target player's", "defending player's") and a step
 * whose turn belongs to a *target* is a sentence no card writes. The derivation owns the spelling;
 * the family owns the membership.
 *
 * ## Three frames, because English has three
 *
 * - **Possessive** — `"{whose} {step}"`. The ordinary form, and the only one that takes the
 *   whose-turn layer as a slot.
 * - **All players** — `"each upkeep"`, `"each end step"`, `"each combat"`. `Player.Each` is spelled
 *   *both* ways ("each upkeep" beside "each player's upkeep"), and which is the majority flips with
 *   the step: 100 lines to 84 for the upkeep, 98 to 22 for the end step, and 0 to 13 for the draw
 *   step, where only the possessive form is ever printed. One rule per step with its own
 *   [com.wingedsheep.assay.syntax.PhraseBuilder.alsoSpelled] list is therefore the honest shape —
 *   the same reasoning [TopOfLibrary]'s impulse durations record, where the canonical word order
 *   flips with the duration. `Player.Each` is consequently absent from [POSSESSIVE], so exactly one
 *   rule can print each of these models.
 * - **Combat** — `"combat on your turn"`, `"combat on each opponent's turn"`. The beginning-of-combat
 *   trigger names the *phase* rather than a step, and Oracle puts whose turn it is in a trailing
 *   clause instead of a possessive: no card prints "your combat". So `Step.BEGIN_COMBAT` is absent
 *   from [stepNoun] and reachable only here, which is what stops the possessive frame printing a
 *   sentence that does not exist.
 *
 * ## Two rows that are one model with the wrong number of words
 *
 * - **`"the end step"`** (62 lines) is the pre-2015 templating for `Player.Each` — Skizzik's golden
 *   reads it as `Triggers.anyPlayer.beginningOf(Step.END)` — so it is a spelling of the all-players rule and not a
 *   fourth frame.
 * - **`"each of your postcombat main phases"`** (9 lines) is `Player.You` again: the SDK has one
 *   `Step.POSTCOMBAT_MAIN`, so the distributive plural and "your second main phase" (32 lines) are
 *   the same model, and the majority spelling prints. If a card ever turns on the difference between
 *   *the second* main phase and *each* postcombat one, that is an SDK gap to report and not a second
 *   rule to add here.
 *
 * ## The attached frame, and what it declines
 *
 * `"the upkeep of enchanted creature's controller"` is `TriggerBinding.ATTACHED` — the SDK's own
 * worked example for `SdkTriggers.<player>.beginningOf(step)`, and Unstable Mutation's and Lingering Death's goldens read
 * it exactly that way. The binding is a third axis of the same factory, so it is one more frame
 * rather than a family of its own.
 *
 * Nine lines of it still decline, and the reason is not in this file: they name a different
 * attachment noun — "enchanted **land**'s controller", "enchanted **enchantment**'s controller" —
 * and the model has nowhere to put that word, because which noun an Aura prints is decided by its
 * `enchant` line. It is printed shape, so it belongs to `normalize/`, whose attachment pass
 * canonicalizes the *adjective* ("equipped" → "enchanted") but fixes the noun at "creature". Widening
 * that pass is a normalization change that reaches every "enchanted creature" in the grammar, so it
 * is named here rather than approximated: this is a write-off with an expiry date, in the sense
 * [Replacements]' condition write-off was.
 *
 * ## What this family is worth, measured rather than claimed
 *
 * "At the beginning …" is the third row of the tail ranking — 197 cards blocked, 104 sole-blocked,
 * 200 lines — and it is a **clause position at the front of its line**, which is the shape the
 * [Durations] band warns about: the ranking counts the cards whose *first* unreadable clause is this
 * one, and for an opening clause that is every card whose sentence the grammar cannot read at all.
 * Substituting a known-good prefix into those 200 lines leaves 17 of them parsing. The payloads
 * behind them are four other bands: "sacrifice ~" as a bare step (the grammar has only "sacrifice ~
 * unless you pay …"), the delayed trigger ("at the beginning of the **next** end step", 91 lines +
 * 55 for "your next upkeep", which is a `CreateDelayedTriggerEffect` inside a sentence rather than a
 * line prefix), the triggering **player** as a subject ("that player draws a card" — the each-player
 * steps almost all have one), and an intervening-if over a step trigger.
 *
 * So this band ships the position, not the 197. What it buys is that all four of those families land
 * on every step spelling the day one of them is written.
