/**
 * Clauses whose number is a **count of something**, and the vocabulary that names the count.
 *
 * Oracle spells a variable quantity three ways, and all three are here because they are one family
 * in the model — a [DynamicAmount] in the slot a numeral would otherwise fill:
 *
 * | Surface | Example |
 * |---|---|
 * | a trailing definition of X | "gets +X/+X until end of turn, **where X is the number of Elves on the battlefield**" |
 * | "equal to …" | "deals damage **equal to the number of +1/+1 counters on it**" |
 * | "for each …" | "you lose 1 life **for each +1/+1 counter on it**" |
 *
 * ### Why the amount is a slot and the verb is not
 *
 * [Steps.countedStep] takes a numeral and [Steps.amountStep] takes a *fixed* dynamic amount chosen
 * by the rule, because in those sentences the amount has no printed form of its own — "X" is a
 * literal. Here it does: "the number of Elves on the battlefield" is a whole noun phrase that varies
 * independently of the verb, so it is a phrase ([count]) and the verbs slot it. That is what makes
 * this a family of two dozen sentences rather than a rule per tribe.
 *
 * ### The where-clause is part of the sentence, not of the amount
 *
 * "…gets +X/+X until end of turn, where X is the number of Elves on the battlefield" is *one*
 * sentence: the "X" in the verb phrase and the "X" in the definition are the same value, and the
 * model stores it once. So the rule spans both halves and the literal "X" appears twice in the
 * template — a card that printed the definition without the use, or two different letters, is not
 * this sentence and declines.
