/**
 * "{T}: Add {G}." — the cost-colon-effect sentence, and the third `CardScript` slot the grammar
 * reaches.
 *
 * ### The clause after the colon is [Steps], not a second effect vocabulary
 *
 * The rule slots [Steps.step] whole and lifts its `CardScript` onto the ability, exactly as
 * [Triggers] does: the effect becomes the ability's effect and a target it declared becomes the
 * ability's `targetRequirements`. So `{T}: Draw a card.` and `{2}: Target creature gets +1/+1
 * until end of turn.` come for free with the mana lines, and every future step rule enriches this
 * file without touching it. The capital on "Add" is not this rule's business either — an ability's
 * effect clause is a sentence start, which [com.wingedsheep.assay.syntax.SentenceCase] owns for
 * the same reason it owns the capital on the line's first word.
 *
 * ### Mana-ability-ness is derived from the effect, because CR 605.1a derives it
 *
 * A `CardDefinition` carries the fact twice — `isManaAbility` and `timing = ManaAbility` — and no
 * printed text says either. CR 605.1a defines a mana ability as one that "doesn't require a
 * target, … could add mana to a player's mana pool when it resolves, and … isn't a loyalty
 * ability", which is a property of the ability rather than a word in the sentence. The rule
 * therefore computes both flags from the effect and the target list rather than spelling them, and
 * an ability that disagrees with the derivation refuses to print.
 *
 * That the SDK needs two fields for one fact is itself a finding: 620 hand-written mana abilities
 * set both, and 24 set `isManaAbility` while leaving `timing` at its `InstantSpeed` default. The
 * engine reads `isManaAbility` and only ever compares `timing` against `SorcerySpeed`, so nothing
 * is broken — but they are not interchangeable in general (the AI's `ExpiringGrantWindow` tests
 * `timing == InstantSpeed` exactly), so the grammar emits the majority form and lets the
 * differential report the rest rather than folding them together.
 *
 * ### One line can be several abilities
 *
 * "{T}: Add {B} or {G}." is two abilities sharing a cost — see [Mana] for why, and
 * [Keywords.qualityRun] for the shape. The rules therefore hand back a *list*, and the single case
 * is the one-element member of it.
