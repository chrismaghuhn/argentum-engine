 * Gate 2 — the **differential**: Assay's reading of a card against the definition a human wrote
 * from the same text.
 *
 * The touchstone ([Touchstone]) proves a parse is reversible. It structurally cannot prove the parse
 * is *right*: a rule that reads "Elves" as `Elve`, or reads a negative condition as its positive,
 * round-trips perfectly and means the wrong thing. This gate is the general answer to that class,
 * and it runs on an asset the incumbent pipeline never had — [ImplementedCorpus], the hand-written
 * cards themselves.
 *
 * ## Fail-closed scoping
 *
 * A comparison is only run where Assay has a **complete** reading of the card: every ability line
 * either round-trips or is a normalized variant ([CardResult.covered]). Comparing a partially-read
 * card would be fail-open — a keyword Assay never saw because its line declined would look like
 * agreement, and the gate would report confidence it has not earned. Everything else is counted
 * into a named [Population] bucket instead, so the denominator is always visible.
 *
 * ## What is compared, at this stage
 *
 * The card's own printed **keyword abilities** — which is exactly the class Phase 1's grammar reads
 * whole, and needs no new grammar to start finding bugs. The SDK spells them two ways
 * ([CardDefinition.keywords] for the parameterless ones, [CardDefinition.keywordAbilities] for the
 * rest), so the hand-written side is unified into one set before comparing; see [printedKeywords].
 *
 * As the grammar grows, the comparison grows with it — triggered abilities, then spell effects —
 * and the scoping rule above is what keeps each addition honest.
