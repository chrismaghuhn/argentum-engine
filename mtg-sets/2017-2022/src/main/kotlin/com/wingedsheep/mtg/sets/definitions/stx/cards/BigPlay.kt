/**
 * Big Play — Strixhaven: School of Mages #122 (canonical printing)
 * {1}{G} · Instant
 *
 * Target creature gets +2/+2 and gains reach until end of turn. Put a +1/+1 counter on it. (A creature with reach can block creatures with flying.)
 *
 * The Snare the Skies pump with a counter rider, all on one target. The first sentence is its own
 * [Effects.Composite] of [Effects.ModifyStats] and [Effects.GrantKeyword] (both until end of
 * turn), and that composite is then followed by the permanent [Effects.AddCounters] — nested
 * explicitly rather than chained with `then`, which would flatten the first sentence away.
