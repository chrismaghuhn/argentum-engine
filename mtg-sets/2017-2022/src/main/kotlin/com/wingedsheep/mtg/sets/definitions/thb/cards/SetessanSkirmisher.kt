/**
 * Setessan Skirmisher
 * {1}{G}
 * Creature — Human Warrior
 * 2/1
 *
 * Constellation — Whenever an enchantment you control enters, this creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn.
 *
 * Constellation is an ability word with no rules meaning of its own — a plain enters-the-battlefield
 * watcher over enchantments you control, bound with [TriggerBinding.ANY] because the Skirmisher is
 * not the permanent being watched. The pump is untargeted: it always hits the source itself, so it
 * is [EffectTarget.Self] rather than a target slot.
