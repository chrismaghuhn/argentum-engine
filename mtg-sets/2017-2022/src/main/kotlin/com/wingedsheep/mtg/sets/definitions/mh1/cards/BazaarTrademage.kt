 *
 * "Draw two, then discard three" is Bazaar of Baghdad's shape on an enters trigger: the draw runs
 * first and the discard is the Gather → Select → Move hand pipeline behind [Effects.Discard], so the
 * three cards are chosen after the two are in hand. The discard is mandatory — with fewer than
 * three cards you discard as many as you can.
