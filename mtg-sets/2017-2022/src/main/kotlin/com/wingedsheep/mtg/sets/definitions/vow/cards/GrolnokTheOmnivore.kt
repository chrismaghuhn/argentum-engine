/**
 * Grolnok, the Omnivore
 * {2}{G}{U}
 * Legendary Creature — Frog
 * 3/3
 *
 * Whenever a Frog you control attacks, mill three cards.
 * Whenever a permanent card is put into your graveyard from your library, exile it with a croak
 * counter on it.
 * You may play lands and cast spells from among cards you own in exile with croak counters on them.
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 * - The attack trigger is `Triggers.<subject>.attacks(requires)` with an `ANY` binding and a Frog-you-control filter, so
 *   it fires once per attacking Frog — Grolnok included, since it is itself a Frog.
 * - The second ability is a plain per-card `LIBRARY -> GRAVEYARD` [EventPattern.ZoneChangeEvent]
 *   rather than one of the batching `CardsPutIntoGraveyardFromLibraryEvent` specs. The printed text
 *   is singular ("a permanent card ... exile **it**"), so milling three permanents must put three
 *   triggers on the stack, each holding its own card as [EffectTarget.TriggeringEntity]. The batch
 *   spec would fire once and hand the payoff a collection, which is a different number of objects on
 *   the stack. Per its first ruling the trigger is *not* limited to cards Grolnok's own mill put
 *   there — any library-to-graveyard move qualifies — which is exactly what the unrestricted event
 *   gives.
 * - `fromZone = GRAVEYARD` makes the exile a no-op if something moved the card out of the graveyard
 *   in response (CR 400.7 — it would be a new object by then), and `addCounterType` stamps the croak
 *   counter as the card lands in exile.
 * - The play permission is a live [MayPlayCardsFromExile] filter over exile, not a set of remembered
 *   cards: per the second ruling it covers every croak-countered card you own "regardless of whether
 *   they were put there by the Grolnok that's currently on the battlefield or by an earlier
 *   incarnation". Cards in exile carry an owner but no controller, so `ownedByYou()` is the right
 *   predicate. Nothing is waived — all costs and normal timing rules still apply, which is what
 *   "play lands and cast spells" means (CR 601.3).
