/**
 * Heated Debate — Strixhaven: School of Mages #106 (canonical printing)
 * {2}{R} · Instant
 *
 * This spell can't be countered. (This includes by the ward ability.)
 * Heated Debate deals 4 damage to target creature or planeswalker.
 *
 * The Urza's Rage shape without the kicker: `cantBeCountered` is a flag on the card itself — the
 * engine reads it wherever a spell would be countered, which is what makes it beat ward — and the
 * body is a single [Effects.DealDamage] of 4 to a [Targets.CreatureOrPlaneswalker] target.
