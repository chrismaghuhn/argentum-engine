/**
 * Witness the Future — Innistrad: Crimson Vow #90
 * {2}{U} · Sorcery · Uncommon
 * Artist: Anato Finnstark
 *
 * Target player shuffles up to four target cards from their graveyard into their library. You look
 * at the top four cards of your library, then put one of those cards into your hand and the rest
 * on the bottom of your library in a random order.
 *
 * First sentence: an optional `count = 4` [TargetObject] over [TargetFilter.CardInGraveyard], each
 * target shuffled into its owner's library ([ForEachTargetEffect] over
 * [Effects.ShuffleIntoLibrary], i.e. `ZonePlacement.Shuffled`). The shuffle rides the move rather
 * than being a separate [Effects.Composite] step, because "shuffles … from their graveyard into
 * their library" is one action per card and the library shuffled is the *card owner's* — Gaea's
 * Blessing's separate `ShuffleLibraryEffect()` shuffles the spell's controller's library instead,
 * which is wrong whenever the targets are an opponent's. Choosing zero targets is legal and simply
 * does nothing here; the printed "target player" is not modelled as a target requirement, since a
 * card target cannot be scoped to another target's graveyard.
 *
 * Second sentence is [Patterns.Library.lookAtTopAndKeep] — look at four, one to hand, the
 * remainder to the bottom in [CardOrder.Random] order (the Memory Deluge recipe with different
 * numbers).
