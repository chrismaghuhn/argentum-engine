/**
 * Gideon's Company — War of the Spark #268 (canonical printing)
 * {3}{W}
 * Creature — Human Soldier
 * 3/3
 * Whenever you gain life, put two +1/+1 counters on this creature.
 * {3}{W}: Put a loyalty counter on target Gideon planeswalker.
 *
 * A planeswalker-deck exclusive, so `inBooster = false` — it is part of the set's card pool but
 * never appears in a booster.
 *
 * The activated ability adds a [CounterType.LOYALTY] counter like any other counter type; loyalty is
 * not special-cased outside the planeswalker's own cost and damage rules. "Target Gideon
 * planeswalker" is the planeswalker filter narrowed by the *subtype*, not by name — it would
 * find any Gideon on the battlefield, yours or an opponent's.
