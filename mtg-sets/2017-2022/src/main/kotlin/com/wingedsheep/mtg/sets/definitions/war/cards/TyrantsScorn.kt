/**
 * Tyrant's Scorn — War of the Spark #225 (canonical printing)
 * {U}{B}
 * Instant
 * Choose one —
 * • Destroy target creature with mana value 3 or less.
 * • Return target creature to its owner's hand.
 *
 * Each mode binds its own creature target because the two differ in what they will accept: the
 * destroy mode carries the mana-value cap, the bounce mode takes any creature. Modal targets are
 * chosen for the *chosen* mode only (CR 601.2b), so the cap never restricts the bounce.
