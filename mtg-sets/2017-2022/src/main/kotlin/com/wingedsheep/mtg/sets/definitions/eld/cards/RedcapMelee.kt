/**
 * Redcap Melee — Throne of Eldraine #135 (canonical printing)
 * {R} · Instant
 *
 * Redcap Melee deals 4 damage to target creature or planeswalker. If a nonred permanent is dealt
 * damage this way, you sacrifice a land.
 *
 * Four damage for one mana, with a land sacrifice unless the thing you hit is red — which is why
 * the drawback clause reads on the *permanent's colour*, not on the spell's. The colour test is a
 * [Conditions.TargetMatchesFilter] over the same chosen target, so it reads **projected** state:
 * a creature painted red by a continuous effect (Painter's Servant, Whim of Volrath) correctly
 * spares the land, and one whose red was stripped correctly doesn't.
 *
 * The sacrifice is [Effects.SacrificeOwn] — the bare imperative "you sacrifice a land", where the
 * spell's controller chooses, not a named player.
 *
 * Ordering matters: the two sub-effects run in one [Effects.Composite], so the colour is read
 * after the damage, while the damaged permanent is still on the battlefield (a composite resolves
 * sequentially with no interleaved state-based-action pass, so a lethally damaged creature has not
 * been put into the graveyard yet and its projected colour is still readable).
 *
 * **Known deviation.** The printed trigger is "*is dealt* damage this way", so damage that is
 * prevented or replaced down to nothing should leave your lands alone. This models the clause as
 * "the target is a nonred permanent", which is the same answer in every case except an active
 * damage-prevention shield — there the card here sacrifices a land where the printed card would
 * not. Fixing it properly needs a "was this target dealt damage during this resolution" condition
 * the SDK does not have yet; it is noted here rather than silently approximated away.
