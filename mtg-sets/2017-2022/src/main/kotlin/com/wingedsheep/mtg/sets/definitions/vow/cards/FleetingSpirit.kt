/**
 * Fleeting Spirit — Innistrad: Crimson Vow #14
 * {1}{W} · Creature — Spirit · Uncommon · 3/1
 * Artist: Evyn Fong
 *
 * {W}, Exile three cards from your graveyard: This creature gains first strike until end of turn.
 * Discard a card: Exile this creature. Return it to the battlefield under its owner's control at the
 * beginning of the next end step.
 *
 * Ability 1 is a straightforward pump: the additional cost exiles three graveyard cards
 * ([Costs.ExileFromGraveyard]) and it grants first strike to itself for the turn
 * ([Effects.GrantKeyword] over [EffectTarget.Self]). Ability 2 is a self-blink for protection
 * ("discard a card" additional cost) — the Meandering Towershell / Skyskipper Duo shape, applied to
 * the source: move Fleeting Spirit to exile now, and a delayed trigger
 * ([CreateDelayedTriggerEffect] at [Step.END]) returns it to the battlefield at the beginning of the
 * next end step. Because it re-enters as a new object, any auras/counters fall off and its ETB
 * timestamp resets, matching the oracle's "return it."
