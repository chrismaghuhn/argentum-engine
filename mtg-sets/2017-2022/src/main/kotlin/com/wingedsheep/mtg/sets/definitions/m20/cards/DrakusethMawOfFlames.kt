/**
 * Drakuseth, Maw of Flames
 * {4}{R}{R}{R}
 * Legendary Creature — Dragon
 * 7/7
 * Flying
 * Whenever Drakuseth attacks, it deals 4 damage to any target and 3 damage to each of up to two
 * other targets.
 *
 * Three target slots: the 4-damage target (index 0), then an "up to two other targets" slot
 * wrapped in [TargetOther] so the pair must differ both from each other (enforced within a
 * requirement by CR 601.2c) and from the 4-damage target (enforced by [TargetOther] against all
 * prior targets). `minCount = 0` makes the pair genuinely optional; an unchosen slot leaves its
 * `ContextTarget` unset and the matching [Effects.DealDamage] resolves as a no-op — the same
 * shape as Trick Shot's optional second target.
