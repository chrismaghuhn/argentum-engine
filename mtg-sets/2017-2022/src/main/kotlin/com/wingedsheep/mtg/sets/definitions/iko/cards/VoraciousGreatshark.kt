/**

 * Creature — Shark
 * 5/4
 * Flash
 * When this creature enters, counter target artifact or creature spell.
 *
 * Flash is what makes the enters-trigger usable as a counterspell: the Shark is cast in response
 * to the spell it will counter, resolves first, and its trigger then goes on the stack above the
 * still-unresolved artifact/creature spell. The trigger targets on the stack
 * ([Zone.STACK]); with no legal artifact or creature spell it simply isn't put on the stack.
