 * Waterfall Aerialist — Strixhaven: School of Mages #61 (canonical printing)

 * Flying

 * Two keywords and nothing else: a plain [Keyword.FLYING] marker plus `Ward {2}` as
 * [WardCost.Mana] (CR 702.21a) — the bare `Keyword.WARD` marker is derived from that ability
 * by the builder, so it is not restated.
