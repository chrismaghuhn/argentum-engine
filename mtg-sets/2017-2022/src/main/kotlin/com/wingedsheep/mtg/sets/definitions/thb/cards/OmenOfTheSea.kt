 * Omen of the Sea

 * Enchantment
 *
 * Flash (You may cast this spell any time you could cast an instant.)
 * When this enchantment enters, scry 2, then draw a card.
 * {2}{U}, Sacrifice this enchantment: Scry 2. (Look at the top two cards of your library, then put
 * any number of them on the bottom and the rest on top in any order.)
 *
 * The blue member of the Omen cycle. The entry trigger's printed "scry 2, then draw a card" is a
 * single ordered sequence, so it is one `then`-composed pair rather than two abilities — the scry
 * must finish before the draw sees the top of the library.
