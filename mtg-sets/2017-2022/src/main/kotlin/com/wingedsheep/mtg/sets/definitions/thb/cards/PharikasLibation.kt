/**
 * Pharika's Libation
 * {2}{B}
 * Instant
 *
 * Choose one —
 * • Target opponent sacrifices a creature of their choice.
 * • Target opponent sacrifices an enchantment of their choice.
 *
 * Each mode names its *own* target opponent, so the requirement is declared inside the mode rather
 * than lifted to the spell: only the chosen mode's target is announced, and the two modes are
 * independent edicts. "Of their choice" is [Effects.Sacrifice]'s default — the named player picks
 * what to sacrifice, not the spell's controller.
