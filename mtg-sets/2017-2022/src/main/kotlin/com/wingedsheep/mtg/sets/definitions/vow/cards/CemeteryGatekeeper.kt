/**
 * Cemetery Gatekeeper
 * {1}{R}
 * Creature — Vampire
 * 2/1
 * First strike
 * When this creature enters, exile a card from a graveyard.
 * Whenever a player plays a land or casts a spell, if it shares a card type with the exiled card,
 * this creature deals 2 damage to that player.
 *
 * The exile is *linked* to the Gatekeeper (CR 607), so "the exiled card" is
 * [EffectTarget.LinkedExiledCard] — the same read-side handle Mirrodin's imprint cards use.
 *
 * The payoff is written as **two** triggered abilities, one per event, rather than as one ability
 * over an `EventPattern.AnyOf`. The two are behaviourally identical — a land play is never also a
 * spell cast, so the pair cannot double-fire — and the split form is what the corpus writes
 * (sixty cards to the union's three) and therefore what Argentum Assay reads and prints. Writing
 * the union here would put the card outside the differential gate for no gain.
 *
 * "If it shares a card type with the exiled card" is a genuine intervening-"if" (CR 603.4), not a
 * trigger filter: it is checked again on resolution, so a Gatekeeper whose exiled card has since
 * left exile does nothing.
