/**
 * Jacob Hauken, Inspector // Hauken's Insight — Innistrad: Crimson Vow #65
 * {1}{U} · Legendary Creature — Human Advisor 0/2 // Legendary Enchantment
 *
 * Front — Jacob Hauken, Inspector
 *   {T}: Draw a card, then exile a card from your hand face down. You may look at that card for
 *   as long as it remains exiled. You may pay {4}{U}{U}. If you do, transform Jacob Hauken.
 *
 * Back — Hauken's Insight
 *   At the beginning of your upkeep, exile the top card of your library face down. You may look
 *   at that card for as long as it remains exiled.
 *   Once during each of your turns, you may play a land or cast a spell from among the cards
 *   exiled with this permanent without paying its mana cost.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *
 *  - **One exile pile, two faces.** Both faces exile with `linkToSource = true`, so the cards the
 *    *creature* squirreled away are the cards the *enchantment* can later play — which is the
 *    whole card. Transforming does not create a new object (CR 712.9), so the
 *    `LinkedExileComponent` written by the front face is still there for the back face's grant to
 *    read.
 *  - **"You may look at that card" is a look grant, not a play grant.** Exile has no
 *    controller baseline for face-down cards (CR 708.5 — "You can't look at face-down cards in any
 *    other zone"), so without an explicit grant the front face would hide your own exiled hand
 *    cards from you until the flip. `MoveCollectionEffect.lookableInExile` is that grant, and it
 *    is deliberately separate from any permission to play: on the front face you may look and
 *    nothing more.
 *  - **The back face's ability is [GrantMayCastFromLinkedExile], not a fresh may-play grant per
 *    exiled card.** "From among the cards exiled with this permanent" *is* the linked-exile pile,
 *    and the static recomputes on every read, so cards keep arriving each upkeep without any
 *    per-card bookkeeping. `filter = Any` is what lets a land be played — a land is played, never
 *    cast (CR 305.1), and it is the same one-per-turn allowance either way, which is what the
 *    printed "**or**" means.
 *  - **The transform clause is a plain `MayPayMana`.** It is part of the activated ability's
 *    resolution, not a second ability, so declining costs nothing and the draw + exile still
 *    happened. `{4}{U}{U}` is paid at resolution.
 *  - **The exile is mandatory and the hand is never empty when it happens**: the ability draws
 *    first, so `ChooseExactly(1)` always has a card to offer.
