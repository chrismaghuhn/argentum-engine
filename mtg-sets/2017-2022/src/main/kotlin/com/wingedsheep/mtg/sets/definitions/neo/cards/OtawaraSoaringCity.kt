/**
 * Otawara, Soaring City — Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty #271 (canonical printing)
 * Legendary Land · Rare
 *
 * {T}: Add {U}.
 * Channel — {3}{U}, Discard this card: Return target artifact, creature, enchantment, or
 * planeswalker to its owner's hand. This ability costs {1} less to activate for each legendary
 * creature you control.
 *
 * The reference implementation of the five NEO channel lands (Boseiju, Eiganjo, Otawara,
 * Sokenzan, Takenuma). All five share one shape:
 *
 *  - **Channel is an ability *word*** (CR 207.2c) — italic flavour with no rules meaning and no
 *    entry of its own in the rules. So it is not modelled as a keyword: it lives in [oracleText]
 *    and nowhere else, exactly as Landfall and Magecraft do on their cards. The ability itself is
 *    an ordinary activated ability.
 *  - **Activated from hand**, paid for by discarding itself: `activateFromZone = Zone.HAND` plus
 *    [Costs.DiscardSelf] (the Steel Wrecking Ball shape).
 *  - **"Costs {1} less to activate for each legendary creature you control"** is
 *    [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.ActivatedAbility.genericCostReduction], which shaves only the
 *    generic pips — so the coloured pip always survives and {3}{U} floors at {U}.
 *
 * Note the target is *any* artifact, creature, enchantment, or planeswalker — Otawara can bounce
 * your own permanent, unlike Boseiju, which is restricted to what an opponent controls.
