/**
 * Gnarlid Colony
 * {1}{G}
 * Creature — Beast
 * 2/2
 *
 * Kicker {2}{G}
 * If this creature was kicked, it enters with two +1/+1 counters on it.
 * Each creature you control with a +1/+1 counter on it has trample.
 *
 * - The kicked-counter clause is a self-only [EntersWithCounters] replacement gated on
 *   [WasKicked], so Gnarlid enters *already* carrying its two counters (CR 121 / 614) — which
 *   matters because the trample-granting static below reads counters in projected state.
 * - "Each creature you control with a +1/+1 counter on it has trample" is a [GrantKeyword] static
 *   over `Creature.youControl().withCounter(+1/+1)` (default `excludeSelf = false`, so a kicked
 *   Gnarlid grants trample to itself too).
