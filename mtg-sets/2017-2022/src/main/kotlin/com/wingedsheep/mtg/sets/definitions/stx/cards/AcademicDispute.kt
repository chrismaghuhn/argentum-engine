/**
 * Academic Dispute — Strixhaven: School of Mages #91 (canonical printing)
 * {R} · Instant
 *
 * Target creature blocks this turn if able. You may have it gain reach until end of turn.
 * Learn. (You may reveal a Lesson card you own from outside the game and put it into your hand,
 * or discard a card to draw a card.)
 *
 * A combat trick that forces a block rather than preventing one — the reach rider exists so the
 * forced blocker can be a flier's blocker, which is why it is optional ([Effects.May]) and why it
 * lands on the same targeted creature.
 *
 * "Blocks this turn if able" is [Effects.MarkMustBlockThisTurn]: a *requirement*, not a guarantee
 * (CR 509.1c) — a tapped creature, or one whose every block would be illegal, simply doesn't
 * block. The three clauses resolve in printed order, so the Learn happens whether or not the
 * creature ends up blocking.
 *
 * `Learn` is [Patterns.Mechanic.learn] (CR 701.48).
