/**
 * Steadfast Unicorn
 * {W}
 * Creature — Unicorn
 * 1/2
 * {3}{W}: Creatures you control get +1/+1 and gain vigilance until end of turn. Activate only during your turn. (Attacking doesn't cause them to tap.)
 *
 * A team pump written as an [Effects.ForEachInGroup] over the creatures you control, whose body pairs
 * [Effects.ModifyStats] with [Effects.GrantKeyword] on each iterated permanent. "Activate only during
 * your turn" is [ActivationRestriction.OnlyDuringYourTurn] — a restriction on *whose* turn, not the
 * sorcery-speed timing rule, which would also forbid activating in your own combat.
