/**
 * Diver Skaab
 * {3}{U}{U}
 * Creature — Zombie
 * 3/5
 * Exploit (When this creature enters, you may sacrifice a creature.)
 * When this creature exploits a creature, target creature's owner puts it on their choice of the
 * top or bottom of their library.
 *
 * The payoff targets a creature, so it rides the exploit reflexive's target requirement
 * ([exploit]'s `onExploitTargets`); the target is chosen **after** the sacrifice resolves.
 * [Effects.PutOnTopOrBottomOfLibrary] pauses for the targeted creature's **owner** to choose top
 * or bottom, matching the oracle wording exactly.
