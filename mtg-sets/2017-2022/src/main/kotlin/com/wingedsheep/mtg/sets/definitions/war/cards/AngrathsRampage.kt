/**
 * Angrath's Rampage — War of the Spark #185 (canonical printing)
 * {B}{R}
 * Sorcery
 * Choose one —
 * • Target player sacrifices an artifact of their choice.
 * • Target player sacrifices a creature of their choice.
 * • Target player sacrifices a planeswalker of their choice.
 *
 * Three copies of the Diabolic Edict shape behind one modal choice: each mode binds its own
 * player target and differs only in the [GameObjectFilter] handed to [Effects.Sacrifice].
 * The sacrifice is the targeted player's own choice, which is what makes an edict an edict —
 * the spell never targets the permanent, so hexproof and shroud on the board do not protect it.
