/**
 * Bond of Flourishing — War of the Spark #155 (canonical printing)
 * {1}{G}
 * Sorcery
 * Look at the top three cards of your library. You may reveal a permanent card from among them
 * and put it into your hand. Put the rest on the bottom of your library in any order. You gain
 * 3 life.
 *
 * The first two sentences are one point in the look-at-the-top family —
 * [Patterns.Library.lookAtTopRevealMatchingToHand], the "reveal it as it goes to hand" spelling.
 * Only the rest-order differs from that recipe's defaults: the Bond cycle says "in any order"
 * (the controller reorders, [CardOrder.ControllerChooses]) rather than the family's usual
 * random shuffle-back. The life gain is a second sentence and composes after it.
