/**
 * Field Trip — Strixhaven: School of Mages #131 (canonical printing)
 * {2}{G} · Sorcery
 *
 * Search your library for a basic Forest card, put that card onto the battlefield tapped, then * shuffle.
 * Learn.
 *
 * `Patterns.Library.searchLibrary` is the gather → select → move pipeline: `ChooseUpTo(1)` is what
 * makes finding a card optional (CR 701.23b — you may fail to find), `entersTapped = true` is the
 * printed "tapped", and `shuffleAfter = true` is the "then shuffle".
 *
 * The two pipelines nest safely: the search stores under `searchable` / `found` and Learn under
 * `learn_hand` / `learn_discarded`, so neither clobbers the other's collections.
 *
 * `Learn` is [Patterns.Mechanic.learn] (CR 701.48).
