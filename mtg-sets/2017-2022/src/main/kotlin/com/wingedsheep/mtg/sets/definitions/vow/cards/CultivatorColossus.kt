/**
 * Cultivator Colossus — Innistrad: Crimson Vow #195
 * {4}{G}{G}{G} · Creature — Plant Beast · Mythic · star/star
 * Artist: Antonio José Manzanedo
 *
 * Trample
 * Cultivator Colossus's power and toughness are each equal to the number of lands you control.
 * When this creature enters, you may put a land card from your hand onto the battlefield tapped. If
 * you do, draw a card and repeat this process.
 *
 * The star/star body is a characteristic-defining ability keyed to your land count
 * ([dynamicStats] over [DynamicAmount.AggregateBattlefield], the Lumra shape). The ETB is a do-while
 * loop ([Effects.RepeatWhile], the Tale of Tamiyo idiom): each pass puts *up to one* land from hand
 * tapped ([Patterns.Hand.putFromHand] uses `ChooseUpTo(1)`, so choosing zero is the "you may"
 * decline) and — only if a land was actually put — draws a card. The loop's
 * [RepeatCondition.WhileCondition] re-reads *this* pass's `putting` collection, so it stops the
 * instant you decline or run out of lands. Because each pass re-gathers the hand, a land put this
 * pass can't be re-selected. Empty hand → nothing put → no draw → loop ends.
