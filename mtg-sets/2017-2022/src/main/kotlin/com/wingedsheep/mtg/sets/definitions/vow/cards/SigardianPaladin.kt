/**
 * Sigardian Paladin
 * {2}{G}{W}
 * Creature — Human Knight
 * 4/4
 *
 * As long as you've put one or more +1/+1 counters on a creature this turn, this creature has
 * trample and lifelink.
 * {1}{G}{W}: Target creature you control with a +1/+1 counter on it gains trample and lifelink
 * until end of turn.
 *
 * The gate is turn *history*, not a board state: [Conditions.PutCounterKindOnCreatureThisTurn]
 * reads the per-player record of what was placed this turn, so the ability stays on even after the
 * creature that received the counter has left the battlefield, lost its counters, or stopped being
 * a creature — all three of which the first ruling calls out. A board scan for "a creature with a
 * +1/+1 counter" would answer no in every one of those cases.
 *
 * "On **a** creature" is also why this is not the per-permanent `receivedCounterThisTurn`
 * predicate (Kid Loki, Beast, Erudite Aerialist): any creature counts, not this one.
 *
 * Two grants under one condition, [GrantKeyword] taking a single keyword — the Nezumi Bladeblesser
 * shape. The activated ability's target keeps the counter requirement in its *filter* (a creature
 * without one is not a legal target); once it has resolved the grant outlives the counter, which is
 * what "until end of turn" already means.
