 * Explosive Entry — Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty #139 (canonical printing)
 * {1}{R} · Sorcery
 *
 * Destroy up to one target artifact. Put a +1/+1 counter on up to one target creature.
 *
 * Both targets are "up to one", so the spell is castable with an empty board and never fizzles for
 * lack of a legal artifact — that is what lets it be a maindeckable artifact answer in a set full
 * of them.
