/**
 * Blood Hypnotist
 * {2}{R}
 * Creature — Vampire
 * 3/3
 *
 * This creature can't block.
 * Whenever you sacrifice one or more Blood tokens, target creature can't block this turn.
 * This ability triggers only once each turn.
 *
 * "This creature can't block" is the static [CantBlock]. The batch trigger uses
 * `Triggers.you.sacrifices(filter, batch = true)` filtered to Blood tokens (artifacts with subtype
 * "Blood") — it fires once per sacrifice event regardless of how many Blood were
 * sacrificed at once. The "only once each turn" clause is `oncePerTurn = true`; the
 * targeted [CantBlockEffect] defaults to Duration.EndOfTurn ("this turn").
