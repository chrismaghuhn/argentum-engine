/**
 * Thornado — Modern Horizons #184
 * {2}{G} · Instant
 *
 * Destroy target creature with flying.
 * Cycling {1}{G}
 *
 * "With flying" is a restriction on the *target*, not a condition on the effect, so it lives in
 * the target requirement — [Targets.CreatureWithKeyword] — and is rechecked at resolution
 * (CR 608.2b): a creature that loses flying in response is no longer a legal target and the spell
 * fizzles rather than destroying it.
 *
 * The keyword check must read projected characteristics, which is what
 * `GameObjectFilter.Creature.withKeyword` gives it — a creature granted flying by an Aura or a
 * lord is a legal target, and one whose flying was removed is not.
 *
 * Green removal with a mode-like escape hatch: cycling costs less than the spell, so an opponent
 * with no fliers doesn't leave you holding a dead card. Cycling contributes no simple keyword to
 * `keywords` — it is purely the parameterized ability.
