/**
 * Demon Bolt
 * {2}{R}
 * Instant
 * Demon Bolt deals 4 damage to target creature or planeswalker.
 * Foretell {R} (During your turn, you may pay {2} and exile this card from your hand face down. Cast it on a later turn for its foretell cost.)
 *
 * A one-line burn spell: [Effects.DealDamage] with a fixed 4 aimed at a single
 * [Targets.CreatureOrPlaneswalker] binding. Foretell is the only structural part — the bare
 * `Keyword.FORETELL` is display-only, so it is lowered into [KeywordAbility.foretell], which the
 * engine's ForetellEnumerator reads to offer the pay-{2}-and-exile special action and the later
 * {R} cast from exile. The card builder derives the printed FORETELL keyword from that ability.
