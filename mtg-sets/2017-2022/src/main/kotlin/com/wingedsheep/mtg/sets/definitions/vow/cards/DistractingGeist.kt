/**
 * Distracting Geist // Clever Distraction (Innistrad: Crimson Vow #9 — the card's earliest
 * printing)
 * {2}{W} · Creature — Spirit 2/1 // Enchantment — Aura
 *
 * Front — Distracting Geist ({2}{W}, Creature — Spirit, 2/1)
 *   Whenever this creature attacks, tap target creature defending player controls.
 *   Disturb {4}{W}
 *
 * Back — Clever Distraction (Enchantment — Aura, white color indicator)
 *   Enchant creature
 *   Enchanted creature has "Whenever this creature attacks, tap target creature defending player
 *   controls."
 *   If Clever Distraction would be put into a graveyard from anywhere, exile it instead.
 *
 * Implementation: "defending player controls" is modelled as `Targets.CreatureOpponentControls`,
 * the convention every attack-trigger card here uses for the defending player (Spring Splasher,
 * Thunder Lasso, Web-Shooters). The back face prints the front face's ability in quotation marks,
 * so it is a [GrantTriggeredAbility] rebuilding that same ability — the granted ability carries its
 * own `targetRequirement`, and `Effects.Tap` reads it back as `ContextTarget(0)`. It keeps
 * `Triggers.self.attacks()`' SELF binding: "this creature" inside the quotes is whatever creature has the
 * ability, i.e. the enchanted creature, and `GrantTriggeredAbility` defaults its filter to the
 * attached creature. Disturb is CR 702.146; the disturb cast puts the card on the stack back face
 * up (CR 712.8c) as an Aura spell, and the exile-instead clause is [RedirectZoneChange] with
 * `selfOnly = true` so it functions in every zone (CR 614.12).
