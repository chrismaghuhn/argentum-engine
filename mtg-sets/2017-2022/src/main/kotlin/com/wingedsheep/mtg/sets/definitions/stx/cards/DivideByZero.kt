/**
 * Divide by Zero — Strixhaven: School of Mages #41 (canonical printing)
 * {2}{U} · Instant
 *
 * Return target spell or permanent with mana value 1 or greater to its owner's hand.
 * Learn.
 *
 * The one printed restriction applies to *both* halves of the target, so it is passed to both
 * filters of [TargetSpellOrPermanent]: a {0} spell on the stack (Memnite, a Mox) is no more a
 * legal target than a land on the battlefield is. Before this card the stack half of that
 * requirement carried no filter at all — see the SDK field's docs.
 *
 * `Learn` is [Patterns.Mechanic.learn] (CR 701.48), and it runs *after* the bounce in printed
 * order — so a card returned to your own hand is already there to be pitched to the Learn's
 * discard.
 *
 * Known limitation, narrow enough to be worth naming: mana value is read off the card, so a
 * spell on the stack whose cost is purely `{X}` reads as MV 0 rather than the value chosen for X
 * (CR 202.3b). That makes such a spell wrongly untargetable; every other `{X}` spell has a
 * non-X pip and so clears "1 or greater" either way.
