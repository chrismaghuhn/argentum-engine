 * Counter target noncreature spell. If that spell is countered this way, exile it instead of

 *
 * The blue member of the Modern Horizons "Force" cycle, and structurally its sibling
 * [ForceOfVigor]: a free [SelfAlternativeCost] whose only cost is the non-mana
 * [Costs.additional.ExileCards] of one blue card from hand, gated by [Conditions.IsNotYourTurn].
 * The counter half is [Effects.CounterSpellToExile] — the same `CounterDestination.Exile`
 * rider Spelljack uses, minus the free-cast grant — restricted to
 * [Targets.NoncreatureSpell].
