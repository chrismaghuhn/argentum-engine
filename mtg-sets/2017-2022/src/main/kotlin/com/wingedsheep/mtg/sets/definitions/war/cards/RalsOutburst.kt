/**
 * Ral's Outburst — War of the Spark #212 (canonical printing)
 * {2}{U}{R}
 * Instant
 * Ral's Outburst deals 3 damage to any target. Look at the top two cards of your library. Put
 * one of them into your hand and the other into your graveyard.
 *
 * Two sentences, two effects. The second is [Patterns.Library.lookAtTopAndKeep] at its plainest:
 * the keep destination and the rest destination are the recipe's own defaults (hand and
 * graveyard), which is also where its "Put in hand" / "Put in graveyard" choice labels come
 * from — so nothing beyond the two counts needs saying.
