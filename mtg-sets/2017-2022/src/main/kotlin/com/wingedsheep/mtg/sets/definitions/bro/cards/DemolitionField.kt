/**
 * Demolition Field
 * Land
 * {T}: Add {C}.
 * {2}, {T}, Sacrifice this land: Destroy target nonbasic land an opponent controls. That land's
 * controller may search their library for a basic land card, put it onto the battlefield, then
 * shuffle. You may search your library for a basic land card, put it onto the battlefield, then
 * shuffle.
 *
 * "That land's controller" is [Player.ControllerOf] the destroyed land — resolved after the land
 * dies, so in the normal case (an opponent controlling their own land) it reads the graveyard
 * card's owner, which is that same player. Their optional basic-land fetch runs under
 * [Effects.ForEachPlayer], which rebinds `Player.You` inside the search to that player; the
 * controller's own optional fetch follows as a plain `Player.You` search.
