/**
 * Quakefoot Cyclops — Modern Horizons #142
 * {4}{R} · Creature — Cyclops · 4/4
 *
 * When this creature enters, up to two target creatures can't block this turn.
 * Cycling {1}{R}
 * When you cycle this card, target creature can't block this turn.
 *
 * "Up to two target creatures" is one requirement with `count = 2, optional = true` (CR 601.2c —
 * the minimum drops to zero), not two separate slots, so the restriction is applied through
 * [ForEachTargetEffect] with [EffectTarget.ContextTarget]`(0)`: each chosen target gets its own
 * iteration, and the number of iterations is owned by the requirement rather than duplicated in
 * the effect. The cycling trigger targets exactly one creature and can name it directly.
 *
 * The cycling trigger is a real triggered ability that goes on the stack from the graveyard-bound
 * discard (CR 702.29b), so it resolves — and its target is chosen — even though the Cyclops itself
 * never reaches the battlefield.
