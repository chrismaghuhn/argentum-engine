/**
 * Access Tunnel — Strixhaven: School of Mages #262 (canonical printing)
 * (no mana cost) · Land
 *
 * {T}: Add {C}.
 * {3}, {T}: Target creature with power 3 or less can't be blocked this turn.
 *
 * A colourless utility land in the Rogue's Passage shape. The first ability is a plain colourless
 * mana ability; the second targets, so it is a regular activated ability that grants the
 * [AbilityFlag.CANT_BE_BLOCKED] flag until end of turn to a creature picked through
 * [Targets.CreatureWithPowerAtMost] — the power check is a targeting restriction, not a resolution
 * condition.
