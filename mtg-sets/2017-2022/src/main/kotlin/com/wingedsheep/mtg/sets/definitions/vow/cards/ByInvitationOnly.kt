/**
 * By Invitation Only
 * {3}{W}{W}
 * Sorcery
 *
 * Choose a number between 0 and 13. Each player sacrifices that many creatures of their choice.
 *
 * Blasphemous Edict with the 13 made a choice: the same `ForceSacrificeEffect` over
 * `Player.Each`, but with [DynamicAmount.XValue] where that card writes `count = 13`.
 * [Effects.ChooseNumberThen] stamps the chosen number onto the resolution context as X, which is
 * exactly what `XValue` reads, so "that many" needs no reference of its own — the number is one
 * value shared by every player's sacrifice, not a fresh choice per player.
 *
 * The count is a *maximum*, not a requirement: a player controlling fewer creatures than the
 * chosen number sacrifices all of them (second ruling), which is `ForceSacrificeEffect`'s own
 * behaviour, and 0 is a legal choice that does nothing.
