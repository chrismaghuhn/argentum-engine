/**
 * Brine Comber // Brinebound Gift (Innistrad: Crimson Vow #233 — the card's earliest printing)
 * {1}{W}{U} · Creature — Spirit 1/1 // Enchantment — Aura
 *
 * Front — Brine Comber ({1}{W}{U}, Creature — Spirit, 1/1)
 *   Whenever this creature enters or becomes the target of an Aura spell, create a 1/1 white
 *   Spirit creature token with flying.
 *   Disturb {W}{U}
 *
 * Back — Brinebound Gift (Enchantment — Aura, white-blue color indicator)
 *   Enchant creature
 *   Whenever this Aura enters or enchanted creature becomes the target of an Aura spell, create a
 *   1/1 white Spirit creature token with flying.
 *   If this Aura would be put into a graveyard from anywhere, exile it instead.
 *
 * Implementation: each face's printed "enters **or** becomes the target" is two triggered
 * abilities, the house shape for an or-joined trigger (Crow of Dark Tidings' enters/dies) — and
 * here it is forced, because the back face's two halves don't even share a binding: the Aura's own
 * ETB is SELF-bound while "enchanted creature becomes the target" is
 * [TriggerBinding.ATTACHED]-bound. Both target halves use `Triggers.<subject>.becomesTarget(of = Aura, spellsOnly = true)`,
 * which reads the *targeting* spell through `BecomesTargetEvent.sourceFilter`.
 *
 * An Aura spell chooses its target as it is cast (CR 303.4a), so neither half fires for the Aura
 * that is already attached — only for a new Aura spell cast at the creature. Disturb (CR 702.146)
 * puts the card on the stack back face up (CR 712.8c), so the disturb cast is itself an Aura spell
 * that picks its host from `auraTarget`; that cast targets the creature, which means a *different*
 * Brine Comber already on the battlefield sees it. The exile-instead clause is
 * [RedirectZoneChange] with `selfOnly = true` so it functions from every zone (CR 614.12).
