/**
 * Rise of Extus — Strixhaven: School of Mages #226 (canonical printing)
 * {4}{W/B}{W/B} · Sorcery
 *
 * Exile target creature. Exile up to one target instant or sorcery card from a graveyard.
 * Learn.
 *
 * Two independent target requirements, and the second is genuinely optional: `optional = true` on
 * the [TargetObject] is the printed "up to one", so the spell is castable — and resolves — with no
 * graveyard card chosen. When it is declined, `ContextTarget(1)` resolves to null and the second
 * exile is a no-op rather than an error.
 *
 * Exile, not destroy: indestructible and regeneration do not save the creature, and it leaves no
 * graveyard trigger behind. The graveyard half is incidental instant/sorcery hate — Strixhaven is
 * a spells set, so it is aimed at flashback and Mystical Archive recursion.
 *
 * `Learn` is [Patterns.Mechanic.learn] (CR 701.48).
