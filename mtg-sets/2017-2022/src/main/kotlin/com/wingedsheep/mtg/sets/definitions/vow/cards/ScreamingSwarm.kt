/**
 * Screaming Swarm — Innistrad: Crimson Vow #75
 * {5}{U} · Creature — Bird Horror · Uncommon · 4/4
 * Artist: Irina Nordsol
 *
 * Flying
 * Whenever you attack with one or more creatures, target player mills that many cards.
 * {2}{U}: Put this card from your graveyard into your library second from the top.
 *
 * The attack trigger is `Triggers.you.attacks()` — the batch "whenever you attack" shape that fires
 * once per combat, not once per attacker. "That many" is the size of the batch, read as the
 * attacking creatures you control ([DynamicAmount.AggregateBattlefield] over
 * `Creature.attacking()`, which is evaluated under projected state). The target is a player, and
 * per the Scryfall ruling it may be you.
 *
 * The second ability is activated from the graveyard ([ActivatedAbilityBuilder.activateFromZone]),
 * at instant speed, and puts the card back into its owner's library at index 1 —
 * [Effects.PutIntoLibraryNthFromTop] is 0-indexed, so `positionFromTop = 1` is "second from the
 * top".
