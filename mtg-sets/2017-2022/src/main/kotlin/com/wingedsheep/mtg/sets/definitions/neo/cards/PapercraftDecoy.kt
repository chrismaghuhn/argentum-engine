/**
 * Papercraft Decoy — Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty #253 (canonical printing)
 * {2} · Artifact Creature — Frog · 2/1
 *
 * When this creature leaves the battlefield, you may pay {2}. If you do, draw a card.
 *
 * *Leaves*, not dies: bouncing, exiling or sacrificing it all pay off, which is what makes it a
 * sacrifice-outlet body rather than a chump blocker. [Effects.MayPay] is the "you may pay … If
 * you do" fold — the payment and the draw are one effect, so declining costs nothing.
