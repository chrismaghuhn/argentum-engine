/**
 * Sanguine Statuette
 * {1}{R}
 * Artifact
 *
 * When this artifact enters, create a Blood token.
 * Whenever you sacrifice a Blood token, you may have this artifact become a 3/3 Vampire artifact
 * creature with haste until end of turn.
 *
 * The animation trigger is `Triggers.you.sacrifices(filter)` rather than the batch
 * `YouSacrificeOneOrMore`: "whenever you sacrifice a Blood token" is per-permanent (CR 603.2c),
 * so sacrificing two Bloods to one cost gives two triggers and two chances to say yes.
 *
 * [Effects.BecomeCreature] sets *base* P/T in layer 7b, which is what makes the printed rulings
 * true without extra wiring — a later -2/-2 still applies on top (leaving a 1/1), and a second
 * sacrifice re-sets the base to 3/3 without undoing that -2/-2. `creatureTypes` supplies the
 * Vampire and `addTypes` the printed "artifact", which is a no-op union on a permanent that is
 * already one — the literal reading of the sentence rather than a type the text leaves implied.
