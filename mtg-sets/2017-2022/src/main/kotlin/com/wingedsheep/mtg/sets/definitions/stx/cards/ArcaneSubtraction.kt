/**
 * Arcane Subtraction — Strixhaven: School of Mages #36 (canonical printing)
 * {1}{U} · Instant
 *
 * Target creature gets -4/-0 until end of turn.
 * Learn.
 *
 * A combat trick that blanks an attacker's damage rather than killing it — -0 toughness means it
 * never dies to this, so no dies-triggers and no last-known-information subtleties. Power can go
 * negative, which the engine floors at 0 for damage purposes (CR 107.1b).
 *
 * `Learn` is [Patterns.Mechanic.learn] (CR 701.48).
