/**
 * Graf Reaver
 * {1}{B}
 * Creature — Zombie Warrior
 * 3/3
 * Exploit (When this creature enters, you may sacrifice a creature.)
 * When this creature exploits a creature, destroy target planeswalker.
 * At the beginning of your upkeep, this creature deals 1 damage to you.
 *
 * Two independent pieces beyond the exploit sacrifice:
 *  - The exploit payoff targets a planeswalker ([exploit]'s `onExploitTargets` = [Targets.Planeswalker]),
 *    chosen after the sacrifice resolves; the reflexive is only put on the stack when a legal
 *    planeswalker exists, so exploiting with no planeswalker in play just performs the sacrifice.
 *  - A `Triggers.you.beginningOf(Step.UPKEEP)` drawback that deals 1 damage to you (the controller), mirroring
 *    Ravenous Giant.
