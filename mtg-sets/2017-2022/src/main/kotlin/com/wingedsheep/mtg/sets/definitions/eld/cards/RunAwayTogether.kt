/**
 * Run Away Together
 * {1}{U}
 * Instant
 *
 * Choose two target creatures controlled by different players.
 * Return those creatures to their owners' hands.
 *
 * One requirement with `differentControllers`: any two creatures with different controllers —
 * yours and an opponent's, or (multiplayer) two different opponents'. If both end up under one
 * controller before it resolves, both targets are illegal (the ruling below).
 *
 * Throne of Eldraine (ELD) is Run Away Together's earliest printing, so the canonical
 * CardDefinition lives here; later sets (CMR, CLB, BLB, FDN, ECL, …) carry `Printing` rows.
