/**
 * Igneous Inspiration — Strixhaven: School of Mages #107 (canonical printing)
 * {2}{R} · Sorcery
 *
 * Igneous Inspiration deals 3 damage to any target.
 * Learn.
 *
 * "Any target" is creature, player, or planeswalker/battle ([Targets.Any]). The damage names the
 * spell as its source, so `damageSource = EffectTarget.Self` — that is what lets lifelink,
 * "whenever a source you control deals damage" payoffs, and damage-redirection read the right
 * source.
 *
 * `Learn` is [Patterns.Mechanic.learn] (CR 701.48).
