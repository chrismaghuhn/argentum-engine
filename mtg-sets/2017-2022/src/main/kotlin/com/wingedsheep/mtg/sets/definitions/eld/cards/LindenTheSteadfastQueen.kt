 * Linden, the Steadfast Queen

 * Legendary Creature — Human Noble
 * 3/3
 * Vigilance (Attacking doesn't cause this creature to tap.)
 * Whenever a white creature you control attacks, you gain 1 life.
 *
 * Canonical printing lives in Throne of Eldraine (the earliest real-expansion printing); the
 * Foundations release is a [com.wingedsheep.sdk.model.Printing] row (see
 * `mtg-sets/.../definitions/fdn/cards/LindenTheSteadfastQueenReprint.kt`).
 *
 * The attack trigger fires once per qualifying attacker via [TriggerBinding.ANY] over a white
 * creature you control — Linden is herself a white creature, so she counts when she attacks.
