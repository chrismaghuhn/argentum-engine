/**
 * Vivien's Arkbow — War of the Spark #181 (canonical printing)
 * {1}{G}
 * Legendary Artifact
 * {X}, {T}, Discard a card: Look at the top X cards of your library. You may put a creature card
 * with mana value X or less from among them onto the battlefield. Put the rest on the bottom of
 * your library in a random order.
 *
 * X appears twice and means the same thing both times: [DynamicAmount.XValue] sets how many
 * cards are looked at, and `manaValueAtMostX()` caps what may be taken. Both read the X paid for
 * the ability, so the cost and the filter stay in step without the card restating the number.
 * The rest going back "in a random order" is [Patterns.Library.lookAtTopAndTakeMatching]'s own
 * default; only the battlefield destination differs from the recipe's defaults.
