/**
 * Faithbound Judge // Sinner's Judgment — Innistrad: Crimson Vow #12
 * {1}{W}{W} · Creature — Spirit Soldier 4/4 // Enchantment — Aura Curse
 *
 * Front — Faithbound Judge
 *   Defender, flying, vigilance
 *   At the beginning of your upkeep, if this creature has two or fewer judgment counters on it,
 *   put a judgment counter on it.
 *   As long as this creature has three or more judgment counters on it, it can attack as though it
 *   didn't have defender.
 *   Disturb {5}{W}{W}
 *
 * Back — Sinner's Judgment
 *   Enchant player
 *   At the beginning of your upkeep, put a judgment counter on this Aura. Then if there are three
 *   or more judgment counters on it, enchanted player loses the game.
 *   If Sinner's Judgment would be put into a graveyard from anywhere, exile it instead.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *
 *  - **The two faces do not share a tally.** They are different objects (CR 400.7): a Judge that
 *    died with three judgment counters comes back from the graveyard as a fresh Sinner's Judgment
 *    with none, and has to count to three again. Nothing in the model carries the count across —
 *    each face reads counters off *itself* — so that falls out for free.
 *  - **Front: a true intervening "if" (CR 603.4), back: a resolution-time "then if".** The
 *    difference is printed. The Judge's clause gates the trigger *and* is rechecked on resolution,
 *    so it rides `interveningIf`; a fourth counter can therefore never land. The Aura's clause is
 *    the word "Then", which is checked only while the ability resolves and *after* the counter has
 *    been added — so it is a [Effects.If] sequenced behind the add, and the third counter
 *    kills the enchanted player on the very upkeep it lands.
 *  - **"three or more"/"two or fewer" are counter-count conditions on the source**, not board
 *    conditions: [Conditions.SourceCounterCountAtLeast] and its downward twin
 *    [Conditions.SourceCounterCountAtMost].
 *  - **The defender bypass is a *conditional static*, not a one-shot grant.** Per the printed
 *    ruling, removing judgment counters after the Judge has attacked won't remove it from combat —
 *    which is exactly what a static ability checked at attack declaration does.
 *  - **The Aura enchants a player**, so `auraTarget = Targets.Player` (Curse of Hospitality's slot
 *    in this same set) and the loser is [Player.EnchantedPlayer], not the controller — the Curse
 *    kills whoever it is attached to, and its controller is the one asking for that.
 *  - **The exile-instead clause is [RedirectZoneChange] with `selfOnly = true`** so it functions
 *    in every zone (CR 614.12) — the same shape Spectral Binding uses. Without it the Curse would
 *    return to the graveyard and be disturbable again, which is the whole point of the clause.
