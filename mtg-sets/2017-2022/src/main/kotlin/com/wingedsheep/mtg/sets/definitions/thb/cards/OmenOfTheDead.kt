 * Omen of the Dead

 * Enchantment
 *
 * Flash
 * When this enchantment enters, return target creature card from your graveyard to your hand.
 * {2}{B}, Sacrifice this enchantment: Scry 2.
 *
 * The black member of the Omen cycle: a flash enchantment that cashes in for its spell effect on
 * entry and later sacrifices itself to smooth the next draw.
 *
 * The recursion is [Effects.ReturnToHand] rather than the `fromZone`-guarded
 * [Effects.ReturnToHandFromGraveyard] twin, because the target requirement
 * ([Targets.CreatureCardInYourGraveyard]) already pins the card to your graveyard — a second guard
 * would be redundant on a targeted return.
