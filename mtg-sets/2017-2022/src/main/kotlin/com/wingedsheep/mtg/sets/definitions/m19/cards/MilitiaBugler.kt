/**
 * Militia Bugler
 * {2}{W}
 * Creature — Human Soldier
 * 2/3
 * Vigilance (Attacking doesn't cause this creature to tap.)
 * When this creature enters, look at the top four cards of your library. You may reveal a creature card with power 2 or less from among them and put it into your hand. Put the rest on the bottom of your library in a random order.
 *
 * The whole enters trigger is one composition: [Patterns.Library.lookAtTopRevealMatchingToHand]
 * gathers the top four, offers *up to one* matching card, reveals the kept card into hand, and
 * bottoms the remainder in a random order — the pattern's own defaults supply the destination and
 * the shuffle, so only the count, the filter, and the prompt are card-specific.
