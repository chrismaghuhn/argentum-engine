/**
 * Magma Pummeler
 * {X}{R}{R}
 * Creature — Elemental
 * 0/0
 *
 * This creature enters with X +1/+1 counters on it.
 * If damage would be dealt to this creature while it has a +1/+1 counter on it, prevent that
 * damage and remove that many +1/+1 counters from it. When one or more counters are removed from
 * this creature this way, it deals that much damage to any target.
 *
 * The second line inverts *both* of [PreventDamageByRemovingCounter]'s printed defaults, which is
 * the whole reason it needed new vocabulary:
 *
 *  - **`requiresCounter = true`** — "while it has a +1/+1 counter on it". Unbreathing Horde
 *    prevents damage whether or not it has a counter left; the Pummeler with no counters is a 0/0
 *    that is already dead, and any damage aimed at it is dealt normally.
 *  - **`removalAmount = EqualToDamage`** — "remove *that many*", where Unbreathing Horde's rule is
 *    exactly one counter per damage event however large the damage.
 *
 * The bound matters and the ruling pins it: damage greater than the counter count is *all*
 * prevented and *all* the counters go. So a 3/3 Pummeler taking 5 prevents 5, loses 3 counters, and
 * deals **3** — "that much" is the number of counters actually removed, not the damage. That is why
 * the trigger reads [ContextPropertyKey.TRIGGER_COUNTERS_REMOVED_AMOUNT] off the removal event
 * rather than the damage.
 *
 * The trigger is scoped with `byDamagePrevention = true` — the printed "**this way**". Without it
 * the Pummeler would also ping when a +1/+1 counter left it as a cost or to an opponent's effect.
 *
 * Losing its last counters usually leaves a 0/0 that dies to the toughness state-based action. The
 * trigger has already been put on the stack by then and still resolves, per the ruling.
