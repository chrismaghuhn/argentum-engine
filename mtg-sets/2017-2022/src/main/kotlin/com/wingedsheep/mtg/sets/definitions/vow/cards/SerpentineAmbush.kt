/**
 * Serpentine Ambush — Innistrad: Crimson Vow #77
 * {1}{U} · Instant
 *
 * Until end of turn, target creature becomes a blue Serpent with base power and toughness 5/5.
 *
 * A plain animate: [Effects.BecomeCreature] sets base power/toughness to 5/5 (Layer 7b
 * SET_VALUES), *replaces* the creature subtypes with Serpent (Layer 4) and *replaces* the colors
 * with blue (Layer 5), all for [Duration.EndOfTurn]. Replacement rather than addition is what the
 * printed wording asks for — "becomes a blue Serpent", with no "in addition to its other types"
 * rider, so the target stops being e.g. a white Human Soldier for the turn (contrast Relic's Roar,
 * whose additive wording needs a separate `AddSubtype`).
 *
 * Because the P/T is *base*, a +1/+1 counter or a pump spell still applies on top in the later
 * layers; only the printed 5/5 is what this sets.
