 * Karfell Kennel-Master

 * Creature — Zombie Berserker
 * 4/4
 * When this creature enters, up to two target creatures each get +1/+0 and gain indestructible until end of turn. (Damage and effects that say "destroy" don't destroy them.)

 * "Up to two target creatures **each** get …" is a multi-slot target: the effect runs once per
 * chosen creature. [ForEachTargetEffect] with [EffectTarget.ContextTarget] `0` is the shape that
