/**
 * Wildwood Scourge
 * {X}{G}
 * Creature — Hydra
 * 0/0
 * This creature enters with X +1/+1 counters on it.
 * Whenever one or more +1/+1 counters are put on another non-Hydra creature you control,
 * put a +1/+1 counter on this creature.
 *
 * `firstTimeEachTurn = false` — the ability watches every counter placement, not just the
 * first on a given creature each turn. Per the Scryfall ruling the Scourge gets exactly one
 * counter per event batch no matter how many counters landed, which is what
 * `countersPlacedOn` (a per-batch watcher) delivers.
