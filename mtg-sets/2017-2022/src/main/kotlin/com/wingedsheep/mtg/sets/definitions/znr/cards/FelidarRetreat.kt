/**
 * Felidar Retreat — ZNR #16
 * Enchantment — Rare
 *
 * Landfall — Whenever a land you control enters, choose one —
 * • Create a 2/2 white Cat Beast creature token.
 * • Put a +1/+1 counter on each creature you control. Those creatures gain vigilance until
 *   end of turn.
 *
 * The second mode iterates the group once and applies both halves per creature, so the
 * "those creatures" that gain vigilance are exactly the ones that received a counter — the
 * set is fixed at resolution (ZNR ruling: creatures you begin to control later in the turn
 * get neither).
