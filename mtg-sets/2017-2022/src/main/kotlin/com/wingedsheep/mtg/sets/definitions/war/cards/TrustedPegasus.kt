/**
 * Trusted Pegasus — War of the Spark #36 (canonical printing)
 * {2}{W}
 * Creature — Pegasus
 * 2/2
 * Flying (This creature can't be blocked except by creatures with flying or reach.)
 * Whenever this creature attacks, target attacking creature without flying gains flying until
 * end of turn.
 *
 * The target filter carries both halves of "attacking creature without flying":
 * [TargetFilter.AttackingCreature] is a *state* predicate read off the battlefield,
 * `withoutKeyword(Keyword.FLYING)` a card predicate. The pegasus itself already flies, so it can
 * never pick itself even though it is one of the attackers.
