/**
 * Setessan Champion

 * Creature — Human Warrior
 * 1/3
 *
 * Constellation — Whenever an enchantment you control enters, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature
 * and draw a card.
 *
 * Constellation is an ability word with no rules meaning of its own, so this is a plain
 * enters-the-battlefield watcher over enchantments you control with [TriggerBinding.ANY] — the
 * Champion is not an enchantment, so the trigger must not be bound to its own source. The printed
 * "and" is the two-member composite `then` builds: counter first, then the draw.
