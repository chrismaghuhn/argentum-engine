/**
 * Riddlemaster Sphinx
 * {4}{U}{U}
 * Creature — Sphinx
 * 5/5
 * Flying (This creature can't be blocked except by creatures with flying or reach.)
 * When this creature enters, you may return target creature an opponent controls to its owner's hand.
 *
 * The target is mandatory at announcement — the trigger carries a `targetRequirement`, so a creature
 * is chosen when the ability goes on the stack — while the "you may" is only the resolution-time
 * yes/no. `optional = true` lowers to that consent gate.
