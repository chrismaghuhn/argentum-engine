/**
 * Toxrill, the Corrosive — Innistrad: Crimson Vow #132
 * {5}{B}{B} · Legendary Creature — Slug Horror · Mythic · 7/7
 *
 * At the beginning of each end step, put a slime counter on each creature you don't control.
 * Creatures you don't control get -1/-1 for each slime counter on them.
 * Whenever a creature you don't control with a slime counter on it dies, create a 1/1 black Slug
 *   creature token.
 * {U}{B}, Sacrifice a Slug: Draw a card.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *
 *  - **The slime counter is a pure marker** ([CounterType.SLIME], added to `CounterType` with this
 *    card). It carries no rule of its own — Toxrill's *second* ability is the only thing that turns
 *    a tally into a P/T change, and his third only asks whether one is present. That split is what
 *    the printed rulings require: both abilities "apply to all creatures you don't control with
 *    slime counters, **even if those slime counters came from a source other than Toxrill's first
 *    ability**", and the third "triggers when a creature an opponent controls with a slime counter
 *    on it dies **for any reason**, not just due to its toughness being decreased".
 *  - **"for each slime counter on *them*" is a per-affected-permanent amount**, not a source
 *    tally. [GrantDynamicStats] is a Layer 7c bonus whose `DynamicAmount` is re-evaluated for
 *    every creature it touches, with `EffectContext.affectedEntityId` bound to that creature — so
 *    [EffectTarget.AffectedEntity] reads *its own* counters. This is Withering Hex's expression
 *    (`Multiply(counterCount, -1)`, the negation idiom — there is no `Negate`) with `Source`
 *    swapped for `AffectedEntity`, and Diligent Zookeeper's per-affected-entity read widened from
 *    one creature to a group.
 *  - **The dies trigger reads last-known counters.** `Triggers.<subject>.leaves(to, excludeTo, excludeSacrifice)` with a
 *    `.withCounter` filter is matched against the `ZoneChangeEvent`'s last-known state when the
 *    creature came from the battlefield, so the counter is still visible even though the entity is
 *    already gone. A slimed creature that dies *because* Toxrill shrank it to zero toughness is the
 *    common case, and it works for exactly this reason.
 *  - **"Creatures you don't control"** is the corpus's `opponentControls()` (Wolf Strike, and every
 *    other VOW card with that wording).
 *  - **`Costs.Sacrifice`, not `SacrificeAnother`**: Toxrill is himself a Slug, so he is a legal
 *    sacrifice for his own ability.
