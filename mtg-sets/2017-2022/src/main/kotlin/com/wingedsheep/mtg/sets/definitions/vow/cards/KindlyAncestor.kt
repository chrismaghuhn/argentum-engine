/**
 * Kindly Ancestor // Ancestor's Embrace (Innistrad: Crimson Vow #22 — the card's earliest printing)
 * {2}{W} · Creature — Spirit 2/3 // Enchantment — Aura
 *
 * Front — Kindly Ancestor ({2}{W}, Creature — Spirit, 2/3)
 *   Lifelink
 *   Disturb {1}{W}
 *
 * Back — Ancestor's Embrace (Enchantment — Aura, white color indicator)
 *   Enchant creature
 *   Enchanted creature has lifelink.
 *   If Ancestor's Embrace would be put into a graveyard from anywhere, exile it instead.
 *
 * Implementation: the same shape as [TwinbladeGeist] — a disturb card (CR 702.146) whose back face
 * is an Aura, so the disturb cast is an Aura spell that picks what it enchants from the back face's
 * `auraTarget` (CR 712.8c). The front keyword and the Aura's granted keyword are the same word, so
 * the back face is one [GrantKeyword] static. The "would be put into a graveyard from anywhere,
 * exile it instead" line is [RedirectZoneChange] with `selfOnly = true` so it functions in every
 * zone (CR 614.12) — including from the stack, when the disturb spell is countered.
