/**
 * Scour All Possibilities — Modern Horizons #67
 * {1}{U} · Sorcery
 *
 * Scry 2, then draw a card.
 * Flashback {4}{U}
 *
 * The "then" is ordering, not a gate: the scry fully resolves before the draw, which is the whole
 * point of the card — you get to decide what the drawn card will be. [Effects.Scry] is the compact
 * macro node the engine expands into the shared Gather → Select → Move pipeline at resolution, so
 * it stays one step inside [Effects.Composite].
 *
 * Flashback is declared as the parameterized [KeywordAbility.Flashback]; the display-only
 * `Keyword.FLASHBACK` is derived from it by `CardBuilder.build()`. The engine's graveyard-cast path
 * and the exile-on-resolution rider (CR 702.34a) both hang off that ability, so no extra wiring is
 * needed here.
