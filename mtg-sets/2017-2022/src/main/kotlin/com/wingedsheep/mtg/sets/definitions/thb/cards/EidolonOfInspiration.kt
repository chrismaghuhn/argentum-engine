/**
 * Eidolon of Inspiration

 * Enchantment Creature — Spirit
 * 2/2
 *
 * At the beginning of combat on your turn, target creature you control gets +2/+0 until end of turn.
 *
 * "on your turn" is the `StepEvent`'s player scope, not a condition: `Triggers.you.beginningOf(Step.BEGIN_COMBAT)` is
 * `StepEvent(BEGIN_COMBAT, Player.You)`. Its each-combat sibling (`Triggers.anyPlayer.beginningOf(Step.BEGIN_COMBAT)`, which
 * Stampede Rider in this same set uses) differs only in that field.
