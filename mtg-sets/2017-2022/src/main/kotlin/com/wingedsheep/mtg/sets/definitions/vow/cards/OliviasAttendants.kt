/**
 * Olivia's Attendants
 * {4}{R}{R}
 * Creature — Vampire
 * 6/6
 *
 * Menace
 * Whenever this creature deals damage, create that many Blood tokens.
 * {2}{R}: This creature deals 1 damage to any target.
 *
 * The trigger is the *bare* `Triggers.self.dealsDamage()` — any damage, of any type, to any recipient.
 * That is wider than the usual combat-damage trigger on purpose: the Attendants' own pinger feeds
 * it, and so does a blocked creature's damage to a blocker, or damage a fight effect makes it deal.
 *
 * "That many" is the amount from the triggering damage event,
 * [ContextPropertyKey.TRIGGER_DAMAGE_AMOUNT], which is why the count is a `DynamicAmount` rather
 * than a fixed number — a 6/6 hitting a player makes six Blood, the pinger's ping makes one, and a
 * damage-doubling effect is read off the event rather than recomputed from the creature's power.
