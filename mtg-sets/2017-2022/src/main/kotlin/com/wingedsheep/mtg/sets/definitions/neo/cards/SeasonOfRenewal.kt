/**
 * Season of Renewal — Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty #205 (canonical printing)
 * {2}{G} · Instant
 *
 * Choose one or both —
 * • Return target creature card from your graveyard to your hand.
 * • Return target enchantment card from your graveyard to your hand.
 *
 * "Choose one or both" is the *count* — `chooseCount = 2, minChooseCount = 1` (CR 700.2) — not a
 * third mode. An enchantment creature card in your graveyard is a legal target for either mode,
 * but each mode targets separately, so both modes can name the same card and the second does
 * nothing when the first has already moved it.
