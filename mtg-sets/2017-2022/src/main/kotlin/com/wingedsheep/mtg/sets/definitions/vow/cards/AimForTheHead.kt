/**
 * Aim for the Head
 * {2}{B}
 * Sorcery
 *
 * Choose one —
 * • Exile target Zombie.
 * • Target opponent exiles two cards from their hand.
 *
 * Mode 1 is a plain [Effects.Exile] over a subtype-scoped target. The noun is **`Permanent`, not
 * `Creature`**: a bare tribal noun in Oracle names permanents of that type, so an artifact Zombie
 * or an enchantment Zombie is a legal target for it. Mode 2 is [Patterns.Hand.exileFromHand], whose default target is the mode's own
 * `ContextTarget(0)`: it gathers the targeted opponent's hand, has *that player* pick two of
 * their own cards, and moves the selection to exile. The printed ruling — "if the target
 * opponent only has one card in hand, they will exile that card" — falls out of the recipe's
 * `SelectFromCollection`, which takes everything eligible rather than stalling when the
 * collection is smaller than the requested count.
