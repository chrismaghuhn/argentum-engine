/**
 * Foreboding Statue // Forsaken Thresher (Innistrad: Crimson Vow)
 * {3}
 * Artifact Creature — Construct // Artifact Creature — Construct
 *
 * Front — Foreboding Statue (1/2)
 *   {T}: Add one mana of any color. Put an omen counter on this creature.
 *   At the beginning of your end step, if there are three or more omen counters on this creature,
 *   untap it, then transform it.
 *
 * Back — Forsaken Thresher (5/5)
 *   At the beginning of your first main phase, add one mana of any color.
 *
 * The activated ability is still a **mana ability** (CR 605.1a): it could add mana, it targets
 * nothing, and it is not a loyalty ability — the omen-counter rider does not disqualify it. So it
 * carries `manaAbility = true` / [TimingRule.ManaAbility] and resolves without using the stack,
 * with the counter riding along in the same [Effects.Composite]. Consequence, and the release-note
 * ruling: because the end-step trigger untaps the Statue only on *resolution*, you cannot tap it
 * for one more mana while that trigger is resolving.
 *
 * The end-step clause is a true intervening "if" (CR 603.4) on `interveningIf`, so a Statue that
 * loses its third counter in response never resolves the untap-and-flip.
