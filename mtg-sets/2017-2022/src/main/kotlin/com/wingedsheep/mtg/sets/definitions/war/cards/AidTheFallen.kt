/**
 * Aid the Fallen — War of the Spark #76 (canonical printing)
 * {1}{B}
 * Sorcery
 * Choose one or both —
 * • Return target creature card from your graveyard to your hand.
 * • Return target planeswalker card from your graveyard to your hand.
 *
 * "Choose one or both" is the modal *count*, not a third "do both" mode:
 * `chooseCount = 2` with `minChooseCount = 1`, the same spelling Scour for Scrap uses. An extra
 * "do both" mode would report one chosen mode where the spell in fact chose two.
 * Each mode carries its own target, both read out of your own graveyard —
 * [TargetFilter.CreatureInYourGraveyard] for the first, and `TargetFilter.Planeswalker` narrowed
 * with `ownedByYou().inZone(Zone.GRAVEYARD)` for the second, since the SDK has no pre-built
 * planeswalker-in-your-graveyard constant. Ownership, not control, is the axis for a card in a
 * graveyard.
