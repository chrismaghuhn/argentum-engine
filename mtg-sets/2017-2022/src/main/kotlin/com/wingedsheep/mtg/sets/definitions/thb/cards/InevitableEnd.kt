/**
 * Inevitable End
 * {2}{B}
 * Enchantment — Aura
 *
 * Enchant creature
 * Enchanted creature has "At the beginning of your upkeep, sacrifice a creature."
 *
 * The quoted ability is *granted to the enchanted creature* ([GrantTriggeredAbility] over the default
 * attached-creature filter) rather than printed on the Aura, which is what makes the quoted "your"
 * mean the enchanted creature's controller: the engine indexes a granted trigger on the permanent it
 * was granted to, so `Triggers.you.beginningOf(Step.UPKEEP)`'s `Player.You` reads that permanent's controller. Printing
 * an ordinary triggered ability on the Aura instead would make the Aura's controller sacrifice —
 * wrong for a card whose whole point is enchanting someone else's creature. Relic Bane is the same
 * shape, and its scenario test pins the attribution.
 *
 * The granted ability keeps `Triggers.you.beginningOf(Step.UPKEEP)`'s own `ANY` binding; an `ATTACHED` binding would
 * drop it out of the trigger index entirely.
 *
 * The sacrifice is [Effects.SacrificeOwn], not `Effects.Sacrifice`: the printed clause is the bare
 * imperative, so the ability's controller chooses and sacrifices one of their own creatures. There is
 * no named player and no target.
