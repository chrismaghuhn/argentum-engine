 * Territorial Boar — Ravnica Allegiance #145
 * {1}{G} · Creature — Boar · 2 / 2
 *
 * [TriggerBinding.ANY] rather than `OTHER`: the printed line has no "another", so a 4-power
 * Boar-pumping creature that *is* the Boar would still count — it just never is, since the Boar
 * is a 2/2. The power test reads projected state, so a creature that enters as a 2/2 and is
 * immediately made 4/4 by a replacement does trigger it.
