/**
 * Creepy Puppeteer (Innistrad: Crimson Vow #151)
 * {3}{R} · Creature — Human Rogue 4/3
 *
 * Haste
 * Whenever this creature attacks, if you attacked with exactly one other creature this combat, you
 * may have that creature's base power and toughness become 4/3 until end of turn.
 *
 * Implementation: the intervening "if" is an exact count of *other* creatures you control that
 * attacked this combat ([DynamicAmount.AggregateBattlefield] with `excludeSelf`, compared `EQ 1`
 * — the Stensia Uprising idiom, since the `AtLeast` helpers can't say "exactly"). Once that
 * holds, "that creature" *is* the one-member group "other creatures you control that attacked
 * this combat", so the set-base-P/T is fanned out with [Effects.ForEachInGroup] over the same
 * filter (a `GroupRef` on a stats effect is not expanded per-permanent — see Sanguine
 * Evangelist). `optional = true` puts the "you may" outermost, so there is a single prompt and
 * the intervening-if is re-checked on resolution (CR 603.4) before it is asked.
 * [Effects.SetBasePowerAndToughness] is Layer 7b, so the creature's own counters and pumps still
 * apply on top of the new 4/3 base.
