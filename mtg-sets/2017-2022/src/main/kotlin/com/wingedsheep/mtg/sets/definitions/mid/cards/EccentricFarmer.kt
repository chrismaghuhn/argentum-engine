/**
 * Eccentric Farmer
 * {2}{G}
 * Creature — Human Peasant — Common (MID #185)
 * 2/3
 *
 * "When this creature enters, mill three cards, then you may return a land card from your
 * graveyard to your hand."
 *
 * Implementation: the ETB half of the same shape as Grapple with the Past — mill first so the
 * milled cards are legal picks, then a `chooseUpTo(1)` over the graveyard's land cards. "You may
 * return a … card" is modelled as "up to one" (declining = choosing zero); an empty pool
 * auto-skips the prompt. No "target" in the oracle text, so this is a resolution-time choice.
