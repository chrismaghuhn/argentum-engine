/**
 * Soul-Scar Mage — Amonkhet #148 (canonical printing)
 * {R} · Creature — Human Wizard · 1/2
 *
 * Prowess
 * If a source you control would deal noncombat damage to a creature an opponent controls, put
 * that many -1/-1 counters on that creature instead.
 *
 * A one-mana prowess body that turns every burn spell, ping and fight into permanent shrinkage.
 * The second ability is a **replacement effect** (CR 614.1a — "instead"), not a prevention effect:
 * the damage is never dealt, so nothing keying on damage being dealt sees it, and — per the card's
 * own ruling — it still applies to damage that can't be prevented.
 *
 * Every part of the clause is carried by the event pattern rather than by bespoke code:
 * `source = YouControl` for "a source you control" (a permanent, a spell on the stack, or an
 * ability alike), `damageType = NonCombat` so combat damage is untouched, and
 * `recipient = CreatureOpponentControls` for the creatures it applies to. The counters land on the
 * damaged creature rather than on the Mage, which is [DamageCounterRecipient.DamagedPermanent].
 *
 * Fight damage is noncombat damage, so a fight an opponent's creature loses leaves -1/-1 counters
 * behind (2017-04-18 ruling) — that falls out of the pattern without a special case.
 *
 * **Known deviation — CR 616.1 ordering is not modelled.** When this replacement competes with
 * another replacement or prevention effect, CR 616.1 gives the choice of which to apply first to
 * "the affected object's controller" — the opponent, here — and the card's own 2017-04-18 ruling
 * spells out both directions they would use it in (converting the damage to counters *before*
 * Insult could double it, so Insult no longer applies; or taking Djeru's Resolve's prevention over
 * the counters). The engine has no 616.1 prompt at all: it amplifies before it replaces, and it
 * places counters ahead of a shield counter — in both cases the order the affected player would
 * not have chosen. That is engine-wide behaviour rather than anything specific to this card, and
 * the `ruling(...)` block below ships the ordering ruling verbatim, so this note is here to keep
 * the two from reading as a contradiction.
