/**
 * Binding Geist // Spectral Binding (Innistrad: Crimson Vow #48 — the card's earliest printing)
 * {2}{U} · Creature — Spirit 3/1 // Enchantment — Aura
 *
 * Front — Binding Geist ({2}{U}, Creature — Spirit, 3/1)
 *   Whenever this creature attacks, target creature an opponent controls gets -2/-0 until end of
 *   turn.
 *   Disturb {1}{U}
 *
 * Back — Spectral Binding (Enchantment — Aura, blue color indicator)
 *   Enchant creature
 *   Enchanted creature gets -2/-0.
 *   If Spectral Binding would be put into a graveyard from anywhere, exile it instead.
 *
 * Implementation: the two faces spell the same -2/-0 twice, once as a one-shot and once as a
 * static, which is why they are two different SDK types rather than one shared value — the front is
 * `Effects.ModifyStats` on an attack trigger (its duration defaults to end of turn) and the back is
 * the [ModifyStats] *static* on the enchanted creature. Disturb (CR 702.146) puts the card on the
 * stack back face up (CR 712.8c), so the disturb cast is an Aura spell that chooses what it
 * enchants from `auraTarget`. The exile-instead clause is [RedirectZoneChange] with
 * `selfOnly = true` so it functions in every zone (CR 614.12).
