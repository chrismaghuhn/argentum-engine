/**
 * Wormhole Serpent — Strixhaven: School of Mages #62 (canonical printing)
 * {4}{U} · Creature — Serpent · 3/5
 *
 * {3}{U}: Target creature can't be blocked this turn.
 *
 * "Can't be blocked" is an [AbilityFlag], not a keyword, so the ability is
 * [Effects.GrantKeyword] over [AbilityFlag.CANT_BE_BLOCKED] on the targeted creature with the
 * default until-end-of-turn duration. Nothing restricts the target's controller, so the bare
 * [Targets.Creature] requirement is correct.
