/**

 *
 * Destroy target creature with power 4 or greater. You gain 3 life.
 *
 * "Power 4 or greater" is a predicate on the target filter (`powerAtLeast(4)`), which the legality
 * check evaluates against projected state — a creature pumped to 4 power this turn is a legal
 * target, and one shrunk below 4 in response stops being one. The life gain is a second sentence
 * in the same effect, so it happens whether or not the destroy still has a target.
