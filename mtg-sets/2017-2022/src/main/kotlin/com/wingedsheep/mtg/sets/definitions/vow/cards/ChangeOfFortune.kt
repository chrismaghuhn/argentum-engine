/**
 * Change of Fortune
 * {3}{R}
 * Sorcery
 *
 * Discard your hand, then draw a card for each card you've discarded this turn.
 *
 * The "then" is load-bearing: the discard runs first and feeds the same per-player
 * `CardsDiscardedThisTurnComponent` that [DynamicAmounts.cardsDiscardedThisTurn] reads, so the
 * cards discarded to this very spell are counted along with everything discarded earlier in the
 * turn — which is exactly the printed ruling. Sequencing inside a [Effects.Composite] is what
 * gets that ordering for free; the amount is evaluated when the draw executes, not when the
 * spell is put on the stack.
