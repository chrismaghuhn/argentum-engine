/**
 * Applied Biomancy — Ravnica Allegiance #153
 * {G}{U} · Instant
 *
 * "Choose one or both" is the modal *count*, not a third mode: `chooseCount = 2` with
 * `minChooseCount = 1` (CR 700.2). Each mode carries its own target, so picking both asks for
 * two creatures — which may be the same creature twice, since the requirements are independent.
