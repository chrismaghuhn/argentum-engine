 * Return target creature or enchantment an opponent controls to its owner's hand.
 *
 * One target, not two: the "creature or enchantment" is a single `Or` predicate on the target
 * filter, and "an opponent controls" is the filter's controller predicate rather than a separate
 * clause. Type and controller are both read off projected state when target legality is checked,
 * so a creature that became an enchantment — or changed hands — this turn is judged as it stands.
