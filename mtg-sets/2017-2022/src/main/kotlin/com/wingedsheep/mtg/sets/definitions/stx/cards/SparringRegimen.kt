/**
 * Sparring Regimen — Strixhaven: School of Mages #29 (canonical printing)
 * {2}{W} · Enchantment
 *
 * When this enchantment enters, learn.
 * Whenever you attack, put a +1/+1 counter on target attacking creature and untap it.
 *
 * "Whenever you attack" is `Triggers.you.attacks()` — a player-level trigger that fires once per
 * combat when attackers are declared (CR 508.1), *not* once per attacker. The target is chosen
 * when the ability goes on the stack, by which time attackers are declared, so
 * [Targets.AttackingCreature] always has a legal choice when the trigger fires at all.
 *
 * Untapping the attacker does not remove it from combat (CR 506.4) — it stays an attacking
 * creature and still deals combat damage; the untap is a pseudo-vigilance rider.
 *
 * `Learn` is [Patterns.Mechanic.learn] (CR 701.48).
