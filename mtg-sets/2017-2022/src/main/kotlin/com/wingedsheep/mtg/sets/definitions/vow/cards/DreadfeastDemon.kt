/**
 * Dreadfeast Demon — Innistrad: Crimson Vow #108
 * {5}{B}{B} · Creature — Demon · Rare · 6/6
 * Artist: Andrew Mar
 *
 * Flying
 * At the beginning of your end step, sacrifice a non-Demon creature. If you do, create a token
 * that's a copy of this creature.
 *
 * The "sacrifice … If you do, …" is a gated composite ([Effects.IfYouDo]): the copy runs only when
 * the sacrifice actually happened (CR 608.2 "if you do" — if there's nothing to sacrifice, the copy
 * is skipped). The sacrifice is *mandatory* but requires a valid non-Demon creature, so it is
 * modeled as a gather → `chooseExactly(1)` → `sacrifice` pipeline whose terminal move is the
 * gate's success probe (`SuccessCriterion.Auto` infers success from the graveyard growing):
 *   - no non-Demon fodder → nothing eligible → empty move → graveyard unchanged → no copy;
 *   - exactly one non-Demon → auto-selected (no prompt) → sacrificed → copy;
 *   - several → controller must pick one to sacrifice → copy.
 * The `notSubtype(Demon)` filter keeps Dreadfeast Demon itself (and any Demon token copies it
 * spawns) out of the fodder pool. The copy reuses the general [CreateTokenCopyOfSourceEffect]
 * "copy of this creature" primitive.
