/**
 * Eruth, Tormented Prophet (Innistrad: Crimson Vow #237)
 * {1}{U}{R} · Legendary Creature — Human Wizard 2/4
 *
 * If you would draw a card, exile the top two cards of your library instead. You may play those
 * cards this turn.
 *
 * Implementation: [ReplaceDrawWith] (the Laboratory Maniac shape, applying to every draw)
 * whose replacement is the impulse-draw composition [Patterns.Exile.impulse] at count 2 — exile
 * the top two, then a may-play-from-exile grant on those cards that expires at end of turn. Each
 * replaced draw is its own impulse, so "draw two" exiles four. An empty library exiles nothing and
 * the draw was still replaced, so it can't be lost to (the card's own ruling).
