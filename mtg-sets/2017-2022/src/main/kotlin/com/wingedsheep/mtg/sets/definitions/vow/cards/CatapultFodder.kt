/**
 * Catapult Fodder // Catapult Captain (Innistrad: Crimson Vow)
 * {2}{B}
 * Creature — Zombie // Creature — Zombie
 *
 * Front — Catapult Fodder (1/5)
 *   At the beginning of combat on your turn, if you control three or more creatures that each have
 *   toughness greater than their power, transform this creature.
 *
 * Back — Catapult Captain (2/6)
 *   {2}{B}, {T}, Sacrifice another creature: Target opponent loses life equal to the sacrificed
 *   creature's toughness.
 *
 * The front's clause is a true intervening "if" (CR 603.4) — it gates the trigger *and* is
 * rechecked on resolution — so it rides `interveningIf` rather than wrapping the effect. Each of
 * the three creatures is measured against **its own** power, per the release-note ruling, which is
 * exactly what [ObjectFilter.toughnessGreaterThanPower] does: a per-permanent predicate counted by
 * [Conditions.YouControlAtLeast], not an aggregate comparison across the board. The Fodder itself
 * (1/5) is one of the three.
 *
 * The back reads the toughness of the creature paid as a *cost*, so the value comes from the
 * sacrifice's last-known information via [DynamicAmounts.sacrificedToughness] — the permanent is
 * already in the graveyard when the ability resolves. Same shape as Kheru Dreadmaw and Ayli,
 * Eternal Pilgrim.
