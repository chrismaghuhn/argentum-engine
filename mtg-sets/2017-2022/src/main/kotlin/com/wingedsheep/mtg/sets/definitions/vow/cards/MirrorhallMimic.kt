/**
 * Mirrorhall Mimic // Ghastly Mimicry (Innistrad: Crimson Vow #68)
 * {3}{U} · Creature — Spirit 0/0 // Enchantment — Aura
 *
 * Front — Mirrorhall Mimic
 *   You may have this creature enter as a copy of any creature on the battlefield, except it's a
 *   Spirit in addition to its other types.
 *   Disturb {3}{U}{U}
 *
 * Back — Ghastly Mimicry (Enchantment — Aura, blue color indicator)
 *   Enchant creature
 *   At the beginning of your upkeep, create a token that's a copy of enchanted creature, except it's
 *   a Spirit in addition to its other types.
 *   If Ghastly Mimicry would be put into a graveyard from anywhere, exile it instead.
 *
 * Implementation: a disturb card (CR 702.146) in the shape of [TwinbladeGeist]. The front is the
 * Clone shape — [EntersAsCopy] with `additionalSubtypes = ["Spirit"]` as the copy exception
 * (CR 707.9b), so declining leaves a printed 0/0 that dies to state-based actions. The back's upkeep
 * trigger is [Effects.CreateTokenCopyOfTarget] aimed at [EffectTarget.EnchantedCreature] with the
 * same Spirit exception on the token.
