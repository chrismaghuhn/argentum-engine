/**
 * Shepherd of the Cosmos
 * {4}{W}{W}
 * Creature — Angel Warrior
 * 3/3
 * Flying
 * When this creature enters, return target permanent card with mana value 2 or less from your graveyard to the battlefield.
 * Foretell {3}{W} (During your turn, you may pay {2} and exile this card from your hand face down. Cast it on a later turn for its foretell cost.)
 *
 * A six-mana flier that reanimates a cheap permanent. The target lives in the graveyard, so the
 * requirement is a graveyard-scoped [TargetObject] rather than a battlefield one; the mana-value cap
 * reads the card in the graveyard, where no continuous effect can change it.
 *
 * `fromZone = Zone.GRAVEYARD` on the move is load-bearing: without it the move looks up the target on
 * the battlefield, finds nothing, and the trigger resolves as a no-op.
