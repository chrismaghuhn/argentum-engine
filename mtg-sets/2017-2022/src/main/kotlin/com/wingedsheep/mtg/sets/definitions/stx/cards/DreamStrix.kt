/**
 * Dream Strix — Strixhaven: School of Mages #42 (canonical printing)
 * {2}{U} · Creature — Bird Illusion · 3/2
 *
 * Flying
 * When this creature becomes the target of a spell, sacrifice it.
 * When this creature dies, learn.
 *
 * The classic Illusion drawback, rebuilt so the drawback pays you: pointing removal at it makes
 * it sacrifice itself — which *is* a death, so the second trigger fires and you Learn anyway.
 * The removal spell is then left with no legal target and is countered on resolution (CR 608.2b).
 *
 * Two rules details the wording pins down:
 * - **Spells only.** Abilities that target it do not fire the sacrifice, so it survives a tap
 *   ability or an equip. `Triggers.a(filter).becomesTarget(spellsOnly = true)` is the filter-scoped ANY-bound version of
 *   this wording; Dream Strix's is self-bound, so the spec is built inline from the same
 *   `BecomesTargetEvent(spellsOnly = true)` with `TriggerBinding.SELF` rather than re-deriving a
 *   filter that means "this permanent".
 * - **Sacrifice, not destroy.** Regeneration and indestructible do not save it (CR 701.17c).
 *
 * `Learn` is [Patterns.Mechanic.learn] (CR 701.48). The dies trigger reads last-known information,
 * so it resolves normally with the Strix already in the graveyard.
