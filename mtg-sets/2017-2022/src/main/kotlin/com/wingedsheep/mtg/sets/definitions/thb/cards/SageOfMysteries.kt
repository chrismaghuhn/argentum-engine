/**
 * Sage of Mysteries
 * {U}
 * Creature — Human Wizard
 * 0/2
 *
 * Constellation — Whenever an enchantment you control enters, target player mills two cards.
 *
 * Constellation is an ability word with no rules meaning of its own — a plain enters-the-battlefield
 * watcher over enchantments you control, bound with [TriggerBinding.ANY] so the Sage (not itself an
 * enchantment) isn't the thing being watched. The mill is [Patterns.Library.mill]'s gather-then-move
 * pipeline aimed at the chosen player rather than the controller.
