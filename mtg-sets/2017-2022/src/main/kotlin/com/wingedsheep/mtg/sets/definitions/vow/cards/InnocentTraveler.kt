/**
 * Innocent Traveler // Malicious Invader (Innistrad: Crimson Vow)
 * {2}{B}{B}
 * Creature — Human // Creature — Vampire
 *
 * Front — Innocent Traveler (1/3)
 *   At the beginning of your upkeep, any opponent may sacrifice a creature of their choice.
 *   If no one does, transform this creature.
 *
 * Back — Malicious Invader (3/3)
 *   Flying
 *   This creature gets +2/+0 as long as an opponent controls a Human.
 *
 * The upkeep ability is Desecration Demon's shape run the other way round: an
 * [AnyPlayerMayPayEffect] scoped to [Player.EachOpponent], but with the transform hanging off
 * `consequenceIfNonePaid` rather than `consequence`. That placement is the whole card — per the
 * release-note ruling, each opponent decides in turn order knowing the earlier answers, every
 * chosen creature is sacrificed simultaneously, and the Traveler flips **only** if that set came
 * back empty. One opponent paying is enough to keep it face up, no matter how many others declined.
 *
 * The back's pump is a [ConditionalStaticAbility] over [Filters.Self] recomputed at projection, so
 * the +2/+0 comes and goes with the opposing Human rather than latching. "A Human" is a permanent
 * predicate, not a creature one — a noncreature permanent with the Human subtype turns it on too.
