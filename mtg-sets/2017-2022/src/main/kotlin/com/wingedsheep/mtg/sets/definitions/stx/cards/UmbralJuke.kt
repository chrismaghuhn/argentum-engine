/**
 * Umbral Juke — Strixhaven: School of Mages #89 (canonical printing)
 * {2}{B} · Instant
 *
 * Choose one —
 * • Target player sacrifices a creature or planeswalker of their choice.
 * • Create a 2/1 white and black Inkling creature token with flying.
 *
 * A choose-one modal whose first mode is the only one with a target: an edict —
 * [Effects.Sacrifice] over [GameObjectFilter.CreatureOrPlaneswalker] naming the targeted player,
 * who picks what to give up. The second mode is a plain [Effects.CreateToken]; token art resolves
 * through STX's synced token printings, so none is declared here.
