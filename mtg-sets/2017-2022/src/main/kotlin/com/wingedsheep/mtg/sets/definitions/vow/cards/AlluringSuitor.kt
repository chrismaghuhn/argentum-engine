/**
 * Alluring Suitor // Deadly Dancer — Innistrad: Crimson Vow #141
 * {2}{R} · Creature — Vampire 2/3 // Creature — Vampire 3/3
 *
 * Front — Alluring Suitor
 *   When you attack with exactly two creatures, transform this creature.
 *
 * Back — Deadly Dancer
 *   Trample
 *   When this creature transforms into Deadly Dancer, add {R}{R}. Until end of turn, you don't
 *   lose this mana as steps and phases end.
 *   {R}{R}: This creature and another target creature each get +1/+0 until end of turn.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *
 *  - **"Exactly two" is the attackers-declared event plus a CR 603.2 restriction, not a new
 *    event.** [YouAttackEvent] carries a `minAttackers` floor only — it is a "two or more" shape —
 *    so the upper bound rides `triggerRestriction`, which CR 603.2 checks *when the trigger would
 *    fire and never again*. That timing is what makes the printed ruling fall out for free: a
 *    creature **put onto the battlefield attacking** never "attacked", and it can only arrive
 *    *after* declare-attackers triggers have been put on the stack, so it is not on the board when
 *    the restriction counts. Using `interveningIf` here would be wrong twice over — it would
 *    re-check on resolution, by which point such a token *is* attacking.
 *  - The count itself is [DynamicAmounts.attackingCreaturesYouControl], the same battlefield tally
 *    Wingmate Roc reads, compared with [ComparisonOperator.EQ].
 *  - **The mana is added by a normal triggered ability, not a mana ability** — it uses the stack
 *    (CR 605.1b: an ability that triggers is never a mana ability), which is exactly what the
 *    printed "When this creature transforms into Deadly Dancer, add {R}{R}" means. The trigger is
 *    `Triggers.self.transforms(true)`, so it fires on the flip the front face just caused and *not* on
 *    a disturb-style cast onto the back face.
 *  - **"You don't lose this mana as steps and phases end" is its own effect**, not a mana expiry:
 *    [Effects.RetainUnspentMana] tags the controller's red mana as surviving every step/phase
 *    boundary until cleanup. Sequenced after the add so it covers the mana just produced.
 *  - **"This creature and another target creature"** is one target slot, excluding the source —
 *    [TargetFilter.OtherCreature] — plus an untargeted pump of the Dancer itself. Two
 *    [Effects.ModifyStats] rather than a group effect, because only one of the two is a target and
 *    the Dancer's own +1/+0 lands even if the target is removed in response.
