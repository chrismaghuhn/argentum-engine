 * Vampire Opportunist — War of the Spark #110 (canonical printing)
 * {1}{B}
 * Creature — Vampire
 * 2/1
 * {6}{B}: Each opponent loses 2 life and you gain 2 life.
 *
 * The drain is two effects, not one transfer: the loss fans out over every opponent
 * ([Player.EachOpponent]) while the gain stays a flat 2 for the controller regardless of how
 * many opponents there are. In a two-player game the two numbers look linked; in multiplayer
 * they are not.
