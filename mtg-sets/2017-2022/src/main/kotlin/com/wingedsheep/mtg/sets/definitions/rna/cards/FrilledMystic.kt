 * Frilled Mystic — Ravnica Allegiance #174
 * {G}{G}{U}{U} · Creature — Elf Lizard Wizard · 3 / 2
 *
 * Flash plus an enters-counter is the Draining Whelk shape: cast it in response, and the
 * counter resolves from the trigger. `optional = true` is the printed "you may" — the DSL
 * lowers it to a `Gate.MayDecide` around the counter, asked at resolution, while the target is
 * still locked in when the trigger goes on the stack (CR 603.3d).
