/**
 * Patchwork Crawler
 * {1}{U}
 * Creature — Zombie Horror
 * 1/2
 *
 * {2}{U}: Exile target creature card from your graveyard and put a +1/+1 counter on this creature.
 * This creature has all activated abilities of all creature cards exiled with it.
 *
 * The Territory Forge shape: the activated ability files each exiled card in this creature's
 * linked-exile pile ([Effects.ExileLinkedToSource]), and [HasAllActivatedAbilitiesOfCards] over
 * `LINKED_EXILE` surfaces every activated ability of that pile on the Crawler itself. Only creature
 * cards can be exiled this way, so the pile never holds anything the static shouldn't read. Per the
 * rulings the grant is activated abilities only, and it names the Crawler in place of the printed
 * card — both are what the static already does.
