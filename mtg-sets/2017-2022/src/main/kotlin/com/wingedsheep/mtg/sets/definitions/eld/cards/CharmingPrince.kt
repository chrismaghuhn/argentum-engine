/**
 * Charming Prince
 * {1}{W}
 * Creature — Human Noble
 * 2/2
 *
 * When this creature enters, choose one —
 * • Scry 2.
 * • You gain 3 life.
 * • Exile another target creature you own. Return it to the battlefield under your control at the
 *   beginning of the next end step.
 *
 * Canonical printing lives here in Throne of Eldraine (earliest real printing); Foundations gets a
 * [com.wingedsheep.sdk.model.Printing] row.
 *
 * The blink mode is the only one that targets, so it is a [Mode.withTarget]; the other two are
 * [Mode.noTarget]. The exiled card is returned by a delayed end-step trigger (SalvationSwan shape).
 * Since the target must be "a creature you own", returning it to the battlefield puts it under its
 * owner's — your — control, matching "under your control".
