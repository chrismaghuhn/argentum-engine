/**
 * Dormant Grove // Gnarled Grovestrider (Innistrad: Crimson Vow)
 * {3}{G}
 * Enchantment // Creature — Treefolk
 *
 * Front — Dormant Grove
 *   At the beginning of combat on your turn, put a +1/+1 counter on target creature you control.
 *   Then if that creature has toughness 6 or greater, transform this enchantment.
 *
 * Back — Gnarled Grovestrider (3/6)
 *   Vigilance
 *   Other creatures you control have vigilance.
 *
 * The "Then if that creature …" clause is a resolution-time recheck of the *same* target, not a
 * second condition on the ability, so it is a [Effects.If] gated on
 * [Conditions.TargetMatchesFilter] against target slot 0 — the handle returned by `target(…)`
 * cannot itself carry a condition (a `target()` handle inside a `Condition` silently evaluates
 * false). The toughness is read off projected state, so the +1/+1 counter this ability just placed
 * counts toward the 6, which is exactly how the card plays: a 3/5 you pump becomes a 4/6 and flips
 * the Grove that same combat.
 *
 * The back's "Other creatures you control have vigilance" is a plain [GrantKeyword] over
 * [GroupFilter.OtherCreaturesYouControl] — the Grovestrider's own vigilance is the
 * printed keyword above it, not a self-inclusion in the grant.
