/**
 * Cemetery Prowler
 * {1}{G}{G}
 * Creature — Wolf
 * 3/4
 * Vigilance
 * Whenever this creature enters or attacks, exile a card from a graveyard.
 * Spells you cast cost {1} less to cast for each card type they share with cards exiled with this
 * creature.
 *
 * The green half of the Crimson Vow cemetery cycle. Unlike [CemeteryGatekeeper] and
 * [CemeteryProtector] the Prowler keeps exiling — one card per enter *and* per attack — so its
 * payoff reads the whole linked-exile pile rather than a single "the exiled card".
 *
 * "Enters or attacks" is two triggered abilities for [CemeteryGatekeeper]'s reason: the corpus
 * contracts the pair in *print* and writes it as two abilities in the model, which is the spelling
 * Argentum Assay reads and prints.
 *
 * The reduction is [CostReductionSource.SharedCardTypesWithLinkedExile], the one reduction source
 * whose amount depends on the spell being cast. Per the card's own ruling it counts *card types*,
 * not cards: two exiled creature cards still make a creature spell {1} cheaper.
