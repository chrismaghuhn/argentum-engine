/**
 * Hamlet Vanguard
 * {2}{G}
 * Creature — Human Warrior
 * 1/1
 *
 * Ward {2}
 * This creature enters with two +1/+1 counters on it for each other nontoken Human you control.
 *
 * [EntersWithDynamicCounters] over a [DynamicAmount.Multiply] of 2: the counted set is "other
 * nontoken Human you control", and the printed "two … for each" is the multiplier rather than a
 * second count.
 *
 * "Other" is `AggregateBattlefield.excludeSelf` rather than a filter predicate — the Vanguard is
 * itself a Human, and the SDK puts the word on the tally (Giada, Font of Hope reads the same way).
 * The ETB replacement evaluates the count with `sourceId` set to the entering permanent, so
 * `excludeSelf` drops exactly the Vanguard while `Player.You` still names its controller.
 * `nontoken()` keeps a board of Human tokens from paying the card twice, and the noun is
 * `Permanent` rather than `Creature` because "Human" in a printed count names a permanent with that
 * subtype, not a type line the card also asserts.
 *
 * `otherOnly` stays false, which is what scopes the replacement to the Vanguard's own entry: the
 * global sweep in `EntersWithReplacements` only considers a dynamic-counters effect when
 * `otherOnly` is set, so the default form applies to the permanent that carries it and to nothing
 * else.
