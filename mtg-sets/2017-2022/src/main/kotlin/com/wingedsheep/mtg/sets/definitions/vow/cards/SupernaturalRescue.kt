/**
 * Supernatural Rescue
 * {3}{W}
 * Enchantment — Aura
 *
 * This spell has flash as long as you control a Spirit.
 * When you cast this spell, tap up to two target creatures you don't control.
 * Enchant creature you control
 * Enchanted creature gets +1/+2.
 *
 * `conditionalFlash` is the Colossal Rattlewurm rail: a timing permission read while the card is
 * still in hand, so it is a `Condition` on the card rather than a keyword or a static ability. The
 * printed noun is a bare "Spirit", which names a *permanent* with that subtype rather than a
 * creature with it — the reading a Spirit land or a Spirit enchanted to be noncreature would
 * separate, and the one Assay's bare-subtype rule takes.
 *
 * The tap is a **cast** trigger (`Triggers.self.isCast()`), not an ETB one — it goes on the
 * stack above the Aura and resolves first, so the creatures are tapped even if the Aura itself is
 * countered or its enchant target has gone away.
 *
 * "Creatures you don't control" is `Not(ControlledByYou)`, not `opponentControls()`. The two are
 * the same in a duel and differ in multiplayer, where a teammate's creature is one you don't
 * control but not one an opponent controls — and this card is legal in Two-Headed Giant.
