/**
 * Twinblade Paladin
 * {3}{W}
 * Creature — Human Knight
 * 3/3
 *
 * Whenever you gain life, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature.
 * As long as you have 25 or more life, this creature has double strike.
 *
 * The grow trigger uses `Triggers.you.gainsLife()` (fires once per life-gain event) placing a
 * single +1/+1 counter on the source. The double-strike buff is a conditional [staticAbility]
 * gated on [Conditions.LifeAtLeast] (25) granting [Keyword.DOUBLE_STRIKE] to the source; it is
 * projected through the layer system so it turns on and off as the controller's life crosses 25.
 *
 * Canonical printing: Core Set 2020 (earliest real printing). Reprinted in Foundations (FDN #503).
