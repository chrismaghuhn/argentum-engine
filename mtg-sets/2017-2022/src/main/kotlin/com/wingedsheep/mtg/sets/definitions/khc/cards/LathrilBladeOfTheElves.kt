/**
 * Lathril, Blade of the Elves
 * {2}{B}{G}
 * Legendary Creature — Elf Noble
 * 2/3
 * Menace (This creature can't be blocked except by two or more creatures.)
 * Whenever Lathril deals combat damage to a player, create that many 1/1 green Elf Warrior creature tokens.
 * {T}, Tap ten untapped Elves you control: Each opponent loses 10 life and you gain 10 life.
 *
 * "That many" reads the trigger's damage payload, so a pumped Lathril makes the right number of
 * tokens. The tap-ten cost excludes the source (`excludeSelf = true`): per the KHC ruling Lathril
 * doesn't count as one of the ten — she is already being tapped by the {T} half of the same cost.
 * The life swing is a fixed 10 each way, not a drain — the controller gains 10 regardless of how
 * much life the opponents actually lost.
