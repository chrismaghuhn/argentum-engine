/**
 * Dying to Serve — Innistrad: Crimson Vow #109
 * {2}{B} · Enchantment
 *
 * Whenever you discard one or more cards, create a tapped 2/2 black Zombie creature token.
 * This ability triggers only once each turn.
 *
 * Two riders, two different mechanisms, and they are not interchangeable:
 *
 * - **"one or more cards"** is CR 603.2c batch wording, so the trigger is
 *   `Triggers.you.discards(batch = true)` rather than the per-card `YouDiscard`. A discard of three cards
 *   is one event and makes one Zombie, not three. Sequential discards inside one resolution
 *   ("discard a card, then discard a card") are separate events and would fire separately — which
 *   is exactly what the second rider is there to stop.
 * - **"only once each turn"** caps the *ability*, not the event, so it is `oncePerTurn = true` on
 *   the ability rather than anything on the trigger pattern.
 *
 * The token enters tapped (`tapped = true`), which is a property of the token being created and not
 * a separate tap effect — no "when this enters" window opens between the two.
