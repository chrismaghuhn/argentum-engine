 * Goblin Smuggler
 * {2}{R}
 * Creature — Goblin Rogue
 * 2/2
 *
 * Haste
 * {T}: Another target creature with power 2 or less can't be blocked this turn.
 *
 * The activated ability taps the source and grants [AbilityFlag.CANT_BE_BLOCKED] (default
 * end-of-turn duration) to a chosen creature. "Another target creature with power 2 or less"
 * is [TargetFilter.Creature] narrowed by `powerAtMost(2)` and `.other()` (excludes the source);
 * the source-exclusion is enforced by the legal-target enumerator.
