/**
 * Fuming Effigy — Strixhaven: School of Mages #103 (canonical printing)
 * {3}{R} · Creature — Spirit · 4/3
 *
 * Whenever one or more cards leave your graveyard, this creature deals 1 damage to each opponent.
 *
 * "One or more … leave" is CR 603.2c batch wording, so the trigger is the batching
 * `Triggers.oneOrMore(filter).leaveYourGraveyard()` with its default any-card filter: a mass reanimation or a
 * graveyard-exiling sweep fires it exactly once. The damage is a single [Effects.DealDamage]
 * aimed at [Player.EachOpponent].
