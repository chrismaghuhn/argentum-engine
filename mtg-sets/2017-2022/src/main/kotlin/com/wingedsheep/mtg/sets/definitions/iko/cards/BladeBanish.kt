/**
 * Blade Banish — Ikoria: Lair of Behemoths #4
 * {3}{W} · Instant
 *
 * Exile target creature with power 4 or greater.
 *
 * The power restriction lives in the target filter (`powerAtLeast(4)`), so legality is checked at
 * announcement and again on resolution — a creature that shrinks below 4 power in response is no
 * longer a legal target and the spell is countered for having none. Power is read from *projected*
 * state, so pumps and lords count.
