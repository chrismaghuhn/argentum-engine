/**
 * Windcaller Aven — Modern Horizons #77
 * {4}{U}{U} · Creature — Bird Wizard · 4/3
 *
 * Flying
 * Cycling {U}
 * When you cycle this card, target creature gains flying until end of turn.
 *
 * The cycling trigger (CR 702.29b) goes on the stack from the discard and resolves from the
 * graveyard, so the Aven grants flying to something else without ever having been on the
 * battlefield — a one-blue-mana evasion trick that also replaces itself.
 *
 * `Effects.GrantKeyword` defaults to [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.Duration.EndOfTurn], which is
 * exactly "until end of turn"; the grant is a Layer 6 continuous effect the projection applies, so
 * a creature that gains flying this way is seen as flying by every blocker check.
