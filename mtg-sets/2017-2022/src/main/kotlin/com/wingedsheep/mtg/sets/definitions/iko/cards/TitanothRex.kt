/**
 * Titanoth Rex
 * {7}{G}{G}
 * Creature — Dinosaur Beast
 * 11/11
 *
 * Trample
 * Cycling {1}{G}
 * When you cycle this card, put a trample counter on target creature you control.
 *
 * The cycling payoff is a separate triggered ability from cycling itself (CR 702.29b): it goes on
 * the stack from the discard and resolves with the Rex already in the graveyard. A trample counter
 * is a keyword counter (CR 122.1b / 613.1f) — [CounterType.TRAMPLE] is wired through the projector's
 * keyword-counter map, so the creature has trample for as long as the counter is on it, unlike the
 * end-of-turn grant a "gains trample" clause would give.
