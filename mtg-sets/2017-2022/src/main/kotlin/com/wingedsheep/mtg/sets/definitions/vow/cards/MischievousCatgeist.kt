/**
 * Mischievous Catgeist // Catlike Curiosity (Innistrad: Crimson Vow #69 — the card's earliest
 * printing)
 * {1}{U} · Creature — Cat Spirit 1/1 // Enchantment — Aura
 *
 * Front — Mischievous Catgeist ({1}{U}, Creature — Cat Spirit, 1/1)
 *   Whenever this creature deals combat damage to a player, draw a card.
 *   Disturb {2}{U}
 *
 * Back — Catlike Curiosity (Enchantment — Aura, blue color indicator)
 *   Enchant creature
 *   Enchanted creature has "Whenever this creature deals combat damage to a player, draw a card."
 *   If Catlike Curiosity would be put into a graveyard from anywhere, exile it instead.
 *
 * Implementation: the back face prints the front face's ability in quotation marks, which is the
 * SDK's [GrantTriggeredAbility] — the same ability the front face has as its own, rebuilt as a
 * granted one. `GrantTriggeredAbility`'s filter defaults to the attached creature, so the Aura
 * needs no explicit filter. The granted ability keeps `Triggers.self.dealsCombatDamage(Recipient.AnyPlayer)`'s SELF
 * binding: "this creature" inside the quotes is the creature that has the ability, i.e. the
 * enchanted creature, not the Aura. Disturb is CR 702.146; the exile-instead clause is
 * [RedirectZoneChange] with `selfOnly = true` so it functions in every zone (CR 614.12).
