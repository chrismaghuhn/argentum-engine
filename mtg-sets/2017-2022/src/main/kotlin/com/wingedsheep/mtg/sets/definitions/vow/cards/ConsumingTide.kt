/**
 * Consuming Tide (Innistrad: Crimson Vow #53)
 * {2}{U}{U} · Sorcery
 *
 * Each player chooses a nonland permanent they control. Return all nonland permanents not chosen
 * this way to their owners' hands. Then you draw a card for each opponent who has more cards in
 * their hand than you.
 *
 * Implementation: the Liliana, Dreadhorde General −9 shape with the fate swapped — gather every
 * nonland permanent (the pool's controllers are the choosers, asked in APNAP order per the card's
 * ruling), `chooseOnePerCategory` over the single category "nonland permanent", then bounce
 * `exclude(pool, kept)`. A battlefield → hand move always routes to each card's *owner*, so
 * "their owners' hands" needs no per-owner loop. The draw runs after the bounce, so hand sizes
 * are read post-return, which is what "Then" means; the per-opponent count is the Wojek
 * Investigator idiom ([DynamicAmount.CountPlayersWith] rebinding `Player.You` to the tested
 * opponent, [Player.ControllerOfSource] falling back to the caster for a resolving spell).
