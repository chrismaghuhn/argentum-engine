 * Natural Reclamation

 * Cascade (When you cast this spell, exile cards from the top of your library until you exile a nonland card that costs less. You may cast it without paying its mana cost. Put the exiled cards on the bottom in a random order.)
 * Destroy target artifact or enchantment.
 *
 * A Disenchant body — [Effects.Destroy] on [Targets.ArtifactOrEnchantment] — priced up to make room
 * for cascade. [Keyword.CASCADE] is display-only, so as on `cmr/cards/AnnoyedAltisaur.kt` the
 * keyword only prints the line and the real work is a `Triggers.self.isCast()` trigger
 * feeding [Effects.Cascade]; cascade fires on the cast, so an instant carries it unchanged.
