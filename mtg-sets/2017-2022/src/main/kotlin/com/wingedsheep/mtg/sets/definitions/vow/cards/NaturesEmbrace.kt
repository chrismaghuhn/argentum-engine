/**
 * Nature's Embrace
 * {2}{G}
 * Enchantment — Aura
 *
 * Enchant creature or land
 * As long as enchanted permanent is a creature, it gets +2/+2.
 * As long as enchanted permanent is a land, it has "{T}: Add two mana of any one color."
 *
 * A dual-mode Aura ([TargetFilter.CreatureOrLandPermanent] auraTarget). Both grants are statics
 * over the enchanted permanent ([GroupFilter.attachedCreature] = `Scope.AttachedTo`, the "enchanted
 * permanent" scope regardless of the host's type), each gated by an [Conditions.EnchantedPermanentMatches]
 * check on the host's *current* type so the buff and the mana ability switch on continuously if the
 * host ever changes types. The granted land ability mirrors New Horizons' `{T}: Add two mana of any
 * one color` ([Effects.AddAnyColorMana]`(2)`).
