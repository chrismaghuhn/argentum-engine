/**
 * Careless Celebrant
 * {1}{R}
 * Creature — Satyr Shaman
 * 2/1
 *
 * When this creature dies, it deals 2 damage to target creature or planeswalker an opponent controls.
 *
 * A plain `Triggers.self.dies()` — no `triggerZone`, which would replace the default `{BATTLEFIELD}` and
 * leave the trigger unindexed.
 *
 * "Creature or planeswalker **an opponent controls**" carries a controller predicate, so it is a
 * filtered [TargetObject] rather than the SDK's bare `TargetCreatureOrPlaneswalker` (which holds no
 * filter at all and only spells the unqualified phrase).
 *
 * No `damageSource`: "it deals" is the source dealing the damage, which is what the effect already
 * means with the field left null.
