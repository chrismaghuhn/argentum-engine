 * Ward {2} is the standard [WardCost.Mana] keyword ability. The activated ability grants
 * CANT_BE_BLOCKED to itself until end of turn (the default [GrantKeywordEffect] duration = "this
 * turn"), gated by [ActivationRestriction.OnlyIfCondition] on "you own a card in exile" — modeled
 * as `Exists(Player.You, Zone.EXILE)` since exile is owner-keyed (a card in your exile is one you
 * own).
