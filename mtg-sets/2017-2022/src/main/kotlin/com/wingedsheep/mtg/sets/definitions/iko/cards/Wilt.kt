 * The green Naturalize with a floor: [Targets.ArtifactOrEnchantment] is a single `Or` predicate, so
 * an artifact enchantment satisfies it once and only one target is chosen. Cycling (CR 702.29a) is
 * an activated ability of the card in hand, which is what makes the card castable-or-not a
 * non-decision in an artifact-light matchup.
