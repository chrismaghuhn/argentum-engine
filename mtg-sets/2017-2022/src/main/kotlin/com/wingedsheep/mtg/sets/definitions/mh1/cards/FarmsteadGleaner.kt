/**
 * Farmstead Gleaner
 * {3}
 * Artifact Creature — Scarecrow
 * 2/2
 * This creature doesn't untap during your untap step.
 * {2}, {Q}: Put a +1/+1 counter on this creature. ({Q} is the untap symbol.)
 *
 * The two halves are one engine: [AbilityFlag.DOESNT_UNTAP] is the self-suppression flag the untap
 * step filters on (cf. Basalt Monolith), and `{Q}` — [Costs.Untap] — is the only way the Gleaner
 * ever untaps, so every counter costs it a turn's worth of attacking or blocking. `{Q}` is a cost
 * atom like `{T}`, not an effect: it can only be paid while the creature is untapped.
