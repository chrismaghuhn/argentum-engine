/**
 * Pondering Mage
 * {3}{U}{U}
 * Creature — Human Wizard
 * 3/4
 * When this creature enters, look at the top three cards of your library, then put them back in any order. You may shuffle. Draw a card.
 *
 * Ponder stapled to a body, and it composes exactly Ponder's three parts: the look-and-reorder
 * pipeline, an optional shuffle, then the draw. The shuffle comes *after* the reorder, so saying
 * yes throws the chosen order away — see
 * [com.wingedsheep.mtg.sets.definitions.lrw.cards.Ponder].
