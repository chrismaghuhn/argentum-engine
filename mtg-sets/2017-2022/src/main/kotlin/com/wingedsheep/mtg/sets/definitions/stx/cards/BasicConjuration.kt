/**
 * Basic Conjuration — Strixhaven: School of Mages #120 (canonical printing)
 * {1}{G}{G} · Sorcery — Lesson
 *
 * Look at the top six cards of your library. You may reveal a creature card from among them and put it into your hand. Put the rest on the bottom of your library in a random order. You gain 3 life.
 *
 * The look-at-the-top dig is [Patterns.Library.lookAtTopRevealMatchingToHand] — a private look at
 * six, an optional filtered pick that is revealed as it goes to hand, and the rest to the bottom in
 * a random order (its defaults). The life gain follows as a plain [Effects.GainLife] in printed
 * order. Lesson is only a subtype.
