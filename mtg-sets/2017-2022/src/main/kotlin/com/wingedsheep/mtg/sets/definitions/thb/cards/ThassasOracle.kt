/**
 * Thassa's Oracle
 * {U}{U}
 * Creature — Merfolk Wizard 1/3
 * When this creature enters, look at the top X cards of your library, where X is your devotion to
 * blue. Put up to one of them on top of your library and the rest on the bottom of your library in
 * a random order. If X is greater than or equal to the number of cards in your library, you win
 * the game.
 *
 * X is [DynamicAmount.DevotionTo] blue, evaluated twice because the card names it twice — once as
 * the size of the look, once as the left side of the win check. Both reads happen during the same
 * resolution, so they agree.
 *
 * The win check is [Compare] `GTE` against [DynamicAmount.AggregateZone] over the library, and it
 * runs *after* the pipeline has put the looked-at cards back — which is what makes the count
 * correct: the cards are still in the library when the comparison is made, exactly as the printed
 * sentence order says.
 *
 * Devotion 0 needs no special case. [CardSource.TopOfLibrary] with a count of zero gathers nothing,
 * the choose-and-put-back steps are no-ops, and the comparison `0 >= 0` still wins on an empty
 * library — the 2020-01-24 ruling.
