/**
 * Slimebind — Ravnica Allegiance #54
 * {1}{U} · Enchantment — Aura
 *
 * `auraTarget` carries the "Enchant creature" line — both the cast-time target and the standing
 * attachment restriction (CR 303.4). The -4/-0 is a *filterless* [ModifyStats] static: with no
 * filter it applies to whatever the Aura is attached to and follows the attachment automatically.
 * Flash makes it a combat trick that blanks an attacker's damage without killing it.
