/**
 * Mire Triton
 * {1}{B}
 * Creature — Zombie Merfolk
 * 2/1
 *
 * Deathtouch
 * When this creature enters, mill two cards and you gain 2 life. (To mill a card, put the top card of your library into your graveyard.)
 *
 * Two printed clauses, so two members of the trigger's [Effects.Composite]: the mill recipe
 * ([Patterns.Library.mill], a Gather → MoveCollection pair that stays nested as its own composite)
 * and the life gain. Written with `Effects.Composite` rather than `then` because `then` flattens a
 * composite receiver, which would splice the mill's two pipeline steps into the outer list.
