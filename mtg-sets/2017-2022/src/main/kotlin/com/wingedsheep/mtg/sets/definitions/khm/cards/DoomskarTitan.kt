/**
 * Doomskar Titan
 * {4}{R}{R}
 * Creature — Giant Berserker
 * 4/4
 * When this creature enters, creatures you control get +1/+0 and gain haste until end of turn.
 * Foretell {4}{R} (During your turn, you may pay {2} and exile this card from your hand face down. Cast it on a later turn for its foretell cost.)
 *
 * The pump and the haste grant are one [Patterns.Group.pumpAndGrantToAll] pass, not a composite of
 * two group walks: the printed sentence names its group once, and gathering it twice would let a
 * P/T-sensitive filter match a different set on the second pass.
