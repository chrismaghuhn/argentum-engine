 * Barrier Breach — Ikoria: Lair of Behemoths #145
 * {2}{G} · Instant
 *
 * Exile up to three target enchantments.
 * Cycling {2} ({2}, Discard this card: Draw a card.)
 *
 * "Up to three target" is one requirement with `count = 3, optional = true`, so zero targets is a
 * legal choice and the spell still resolves. The exile is fanned out with [ForEachTargetEffect] so
 * each chosen enchantment is moved independently — one illegal target on resolution doesn't take
 * the others with it.
