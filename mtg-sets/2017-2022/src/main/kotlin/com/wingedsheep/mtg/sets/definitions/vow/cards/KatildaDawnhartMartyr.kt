/**
 * Katilda, Dawnhart Martyr // Katilda's Rising Dawn (Innistrad: Crimson Vow #21)
 * {1}{W}{W} · Legendary Creature — Spirit Warlock * / * // Legendary Enchantment — Aura
 *
 * Front — Katilda, Dawnhart Martyr
 *   Flying, lifelink, protection from Vampires
 *   Katilda's power and toughness are each equal to the number of permanents you control that are
 *   Spirits and/or enchantments.
 *   Disturb {3}{W}{W}
 *
 * Back — Katilda's Rising Dawn (Legendary Enchantment — Aura, white color indicator)
 *   Enchant creature
 *   Enchanted creature has flying, lifelink, and protection from Vampires, and it gets +X/+X, where X
 *   is the number of permanents you control that are Spirits and/or enchantments.
 *   If Katilda's Rising Dawn would be put into a graveyard from anywhere, exile it instead.
 *
 * Implementation: a disturb card (CR 702.146) in the shape of [TwinbladeGeist]. The front's
 * star/star is a [SetBasePowerToughnessDynamicStatic] CDA over the same count the back's
 * [GrantDynamicStats] adds as a Layer 7c bonus — one shared [spiritsAndEnchantmentsYouControl]
 * amount, a homogeneous `or` of two filters so "Spirits and/or enchantments" counts an enchantment
 * creature Spirit once. The front's protection is the intrinsic
 * [KeywordAbility.protectionFromSubtype]; the Aura grants the same quality as the projected
 * `PROTECTION_FROM_SUBTYPE_VAMPIRE` keyword string, which is the form every engine read site
 * (targeting, blocking, combat damage) already checks for.
