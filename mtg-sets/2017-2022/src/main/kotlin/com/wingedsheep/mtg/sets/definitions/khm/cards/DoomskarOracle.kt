/**
 * Doomskar Oracle
 * {2}{W}
 * Creature — Human Cleric
 * 3/2
 * Whenever you cast your second spell each turn, you gain 2 life.
 * Foretell {W} (During your turn, you may pay {2} and exile this card from your hand face down. Cast it on a later turn for its foretell cost.)
 *
 * The second-spell ordinal is `Triggers.<player>.castsNth(n, spell)` with n = 2 scoped to [Player.You]; the
 * engine tracks each player's per-turn cast count, so no bookkeeping lives on the card. Foretell
 * is lowered into [KeywordAbility.foretell] — it is a real cast, so it advances that count.
