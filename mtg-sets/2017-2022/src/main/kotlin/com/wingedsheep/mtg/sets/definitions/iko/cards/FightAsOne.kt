/**
 * Fight as One
 * {W}
 * Instant
 * Choose one or both —
 * • Target Human creature you control gets +1/+1 and gains indestructible until end of turn.
 * • Target non-Human creature you control gets +1/+1 and gains indestructible until end of turn.
 *
 * "Choose one or both" is a two-mode modal with `chooseCount = 2, minChooseCount = 1`. Each mode
 * carries its own target requirement, so only the picked modes demand a target — and the two
 * filters partition your creatures by the Human subtype, which is what makes casting both a
 * two-creature trick rather than a single doubled pump.
