/**
 * Circle of Confinement
 * {1}{W}
 * Enchantment
 *
 * When this enchantment enters, exile target creature an opponent controls with mana value 3 or
 * less until this enchantment leaves the battlefield.
 * Whenever an opponent casts a Vampire spell with the same name as a card exiled with this
 * enchantment, you gain 2 life.
 *
 * The exile is linked (CR 610.3) — the Glass Casket shape: the leaves trigger returns only what
 * this enchantment exiled. The life trigger reads that same linked pile through
 * [EffectTarget.LinkedExiledCard], so it fires only while the prisoner is still exiled; once the
 * Circle leaves and the card returns, the reference resolves to nothing and no spell matches.
