/**
 * Investigator's Journal
 * {2}
 * Artifact — Book Clue
 *
 * This artifact enters with a number of suspect counters on it equal to the greatest number of
 * creatures a player controls.
 * {2}, {T}, Remove a suspect counter from this artifact: Draw a card.
 * {2}, Sacrifice this artifact: Draw a card.
 *
 * The enters-with amount is the superlative, not the total: no opponent is chosen and the largest
 * single player's creature count is always used (its only ruling), which is
 * [DynamicAmounts.greatestControlledBySinglePlayer] rather than a `Player.Each` count — the latter
 * would sum the table. The Journal's own controller is one of the players measured, so a board it
 * is winning on still fills it.
 *
 * The suspect counter is a passive store with no inherent rule; it shares no machinery with the
 * *suspected* keyword action (CR 701.58), which places no counter at all.
