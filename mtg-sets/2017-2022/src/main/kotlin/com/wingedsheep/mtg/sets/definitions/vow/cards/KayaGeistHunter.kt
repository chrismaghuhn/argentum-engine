/**
 * Kaya, Geist Hunter — Innistrad: Crimson Vow #240
 * {1}{W}{B} · Legendary Planeswalker — Kaya · Mythic · Starting loyalty 3
 *
 * +1: Creatures you control gain deathtouch until end of turn. Put a +1/+1 counter on up to one
 *     target creature token you control.
 * −2: Until end of turn, if one or more tokens would be created under your control, twice that
 *     many of those tokens are created instead.
 * −6: Exile all cards from all graveyards, then create a 1/1 white Spirit creature token with
 *     flying for each card exiled this way.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *
 *  - **The +1 is two independent sentences.** The keyword grant is [Effects.ForEachInGroup] over
 *    `Creature.youControl()` with [EffectTarget.IterationEntity] naming the iteration entity — the group is
 *    snapshotted as the ability resolves, so a creature that arrives afterwards does not gain
 *    deathtouch. The counter rides an **optional** ("up to one") target restricted to a creature
 *    *token* you control, so the ability resolves fine with nothing chosen.
 *  - **The −2 is a durational replacement effect, not a static ability.** It is the same
 *    [MultiplyTokenCreation] that Doubling Season and Ojer Taq print, handed to
 *    [Effects.GrantReplacementEffect] with `Duration.EndOfTurn`; the grant lands in
 *    `GameState.grantedReplacementEffects` and the token-count read path enumerates grants
 *    alongside permanents' printed replacements. Two consequences fall straight out of that
 *    channel and are both correct: the doubler **stacks multiplicatively** with a printed one
 *    (Kaya + Doubling Season turns two Soldiers into eight), and it **survives Kaya leaving the
 *    battlefield** — the loyalty ability is a one-shot that has finished resolving, and the
 *    continuous effect it created lasts until the cleanup step regardless (CR 611.2b). The
 *    printed ruling that the extra tokens are "exact copies of the tokens that were being created
 *    in the first place" is what a count multiplication means here: one creation event, twice the
 *    count, identical characteristics.
 *  - **The −6 is the Gather → Move → count pipeline**, the same shape Quintorius Kand uses:
 *    `CardSource.FromZone(GRAVEYARD, Player.Each)` gathers *every* card in *every* graveyard
 *    (not just creature cards — this Kaya exiles all of them), `MoveCollectionEffect` exiles them
 *    and stores what actually moved, and the Spirit count reads that moved collection through
 *    [DynamicAmount.DistinctEntitiesInCollections]. Reading the *moved* collection rather than
 *    the gathered one is what makes the count honest when a card is replaced on its way out.
