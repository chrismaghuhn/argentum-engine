 * Dollhouse of Horrors

 * Artifact
 *
 * {1}, {T}, Exile a creature card from your graveyard: Create a token that's a copy of the exiled
 * card, except it's a 0/0 Construct artifact in addition to its other types and it has "This token
 * gets +1/+1 for each Construct you control." It gains haste until end of turn. Activate only as a
 * sorcery.
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 * - The exile is a **cost** (CR 601.2h), so by resolution the card is already in exile and can't be
 *   read off the graveyard. [CardSource.ExiledAsCost] names exactly the cards *this activation's*
 *   payment exiled, and gathering them lets [EffectTarget.PipelineTarget] point the copy effect at
 *   the one card that was paid — Necropolis' shape, one step further along. Nothing targets, so
 *   nothing fizzles.
 * - The "except …" riders map 1:1 onto [CreateTokenCopyOfTargetEffect]'s copy-exception fields:
 *   `overridePower`/`overrideToughness` for the 0/0, `addCardTypes` for "artifact **in addition to**
 *   its other types", `addedSubtypes` for the added Construct, and `addedStaticAbilities` for the
 *   quoted "+1/+1 for each Construct you control". Setting the P/T outright is also what the second
 *   ruling requires: a copied characteristic-defining ability that would define power/toughness is
 *   not copied, so the token really is a 0/0 base even off a Lhurgoyf.
 * - The granted static counts *permanents* with the Construct subtype you control — the bare tribal
 *   noun, not "Construct creatures" — and the token counts itself (first ruling), so a lone token is
 *   a 1/1.
 * - Haste rides as an added keyword on the copy rather than a separate until-end-of-turn grant. A
 *   token created this turn can only ever care about haste this turn (summoning sickness ends at its
 *   controller's next untap), so the two agree everywhere except the corner where the token changes
 *   controller later; the separate grant would have to reach the just-created token through a
 *   pipeline handle, which is a strictly worse trade for that corner.
