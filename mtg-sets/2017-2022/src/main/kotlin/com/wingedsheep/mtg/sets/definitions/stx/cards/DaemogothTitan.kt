/**
 * Daemogoth Titan — Strixhaven: School of Mages #174 (canonical printing)
 * {B/G}{B/G}{B/G}{B/G} · Creature — Demon · 11/10
 *
 * Whenever this creature attacks or blocks, sacrifice a creature.
 *
 * "Attacks or blocks" is two triggered abilities sharing one effect — `Triggers.self.attacks()` and
 * `Triggers.self.blocks()` are separate events, the Elder Gargaroth shape. The bare imperative
 * "sacrifice a creature" is [Effects.SacrificeOwn]: the Titan's controller chooses, and the Titan
 * itself is a legal choice.
