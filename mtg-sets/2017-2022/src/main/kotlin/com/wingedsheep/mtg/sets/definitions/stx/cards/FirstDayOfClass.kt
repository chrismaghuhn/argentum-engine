/**
 * First Day of Class — Strixhaven: School of Mages #102 (canonical printing)
 * {1}{R} · Instant
 *
 * Whenever a creature you control enters this turn, put a +1/+1 counter on it and it gains haste
 * until end of turn.
 * Learn.
 *
 * An instant that installs a *turn-bounded, filter-scoped* delayed triggered ability — the same
 * shape as Thunder of Unity's chapters II/III. `fireOnce = false` because it fires for **every**
 * creature you control that enters this turn, not just the first, and
 * `expiry = DelayedTriggerExpiry.EndOfTurn` is the printed "this turn".
 *
 * Scoping is by [GameObjectFilter] rather than a watched entity — there is no single permanent to
 * watch, and the filter's controller predicate is what keeps it from firing on an opponent's
 * creatures. [EffectTarget.TriggeringEntity] inside the trigger is the creature that just entered,
 * so "it" lands on the right permanent.
 *
 * Cast before combat on an empty board this does nothing at all; the Learn is what stops it from
 * being a blank card in that spot.
 *
 * `Learn` is [Patterns.Mechanic.learn] (CR 701.48).
