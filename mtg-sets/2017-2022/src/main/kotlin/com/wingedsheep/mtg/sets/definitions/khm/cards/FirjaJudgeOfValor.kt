/**
 * Firja, Judge of Valor
 * {2}{W}{B}{B}
 * Legendary Creature — Angel Cleric
 * 2/4
 * Flying, lifelink
 * Whenever you cast your second spell each turn, look at the top three cards of your library. Put one of them into your hand and the rest into your graveyard.
 *
 * The payoff is [Patterns.Library.lookAtTopAndKeep] at its defaults — gather three, choose exactly
 * one for hand, remainder to the graveyard. The "second spell" ordinal is `Triggers.<player>.castsNth(n, spell)`
 * with n = 2 scoped to [Player.You]; the engine already tracks each player's per-turn cast count.
