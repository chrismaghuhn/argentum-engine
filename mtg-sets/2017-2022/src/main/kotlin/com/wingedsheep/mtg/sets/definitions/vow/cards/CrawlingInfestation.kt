/**
 * Crawling Infestation — Innistrad: Crimson Vow #193
 * {2}{G} · Enchantment · Uncommon
 *
 * At the beginning of your upkeep, you may mill two cards.
 * Whenever one or more creature cards are put into your graveyard from anywhere during your turn,
 * create a 1/1 green Insect creature token. This ability triggers only once each turn.
 *
 * The two abilities are one engine: the upkeep mill is the cheapest way to feed the second, but
 * the second reads "from anywhere", so a creature dying in combat or discarded feeds it just as
 * well — hence `Triggers.oneOrMore(filter).putIntoYourGraveyard()` (the batching trigger, one Insect for a
 * whole board wipe) rather than a dies trigger.
 *
 * Two riders, two different knobs, and they are not interchangeable:
 *  - "during your turn" is a `triggerRestriction` ([Conditions.IsYourTurn]);
 *  - "This ability triggers only once each turn" is `oncePerTurn = true`, the cap spent by the
 *    first trigger. It is *not* `effectOncePerTurn` — nothing here is optional, so there is no
 *    decline that could leave the turn's use unspent.
