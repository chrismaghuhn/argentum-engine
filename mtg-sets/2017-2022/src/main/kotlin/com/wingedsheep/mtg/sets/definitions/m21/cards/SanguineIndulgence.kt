/**
 * Sanguine Indulgence
 * {3}{B}
 * Sorcery
 * This spell costs {3} less to cast if you've gained 3 or more life this turn.
 * Return up to two target creature cards from your graveyard to your hand.
 *
 * The discount is a self-cast [ModifySpellCost] gated by [CostGating.OnlyIf] on
 * [Conditions.YouGainedLifeThisTurnAtLeast] (3), backed by the `LIFE_GAINED` turn tracker —
 * so it is evaluated as the spell is cast (CR 601.2f) and drops the whole generic component,
 * leaving {B}.
 *
 * "Up to two target" is `TargetObject(count = 2, optional = true)`, so zero, one, or two cards
 * may be chosen; each chosen card is returned independently via [ForEachTargetEffect] (a card
 * that left the graveyard in response simply isn't returned, and the spell still resolves for
 * the remaining legal target).
