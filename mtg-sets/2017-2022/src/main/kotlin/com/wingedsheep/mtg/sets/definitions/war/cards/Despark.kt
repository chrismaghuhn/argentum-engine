/**
 * Despark — War of the Spark #190 (canonical printing)
 * {W}{B}
 * Instant
 * Exile target permanent with mana value 4 or greater.
 *
 * The mana-value floor rides on the target filter, not on the effect: the restriction is a
 * legality condition re-checked on resolution (CR 608.2b), so a permanent whose mana value
 * drops below 4 in response is no longer a legal target and the spell is countered by the game
 * rules. Exiling with [Effects.Exile] and not destroying is the point of the card — it answers
 * indestructible permanents and planeswalkers alike.
