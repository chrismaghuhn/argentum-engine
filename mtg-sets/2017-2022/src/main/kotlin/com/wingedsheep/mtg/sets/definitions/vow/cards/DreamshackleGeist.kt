/**
 * Dreamshackle Geist
 * {1}{U}{U}
 * Creature — Spirit
 * 3/1
 *
 * Flying
 * At the beginning of combat on your turn, choose up to one —
 * • Tap target creature.
 * • Target creature doesn't untap during its controller's next untap step.
 *
 * The Sawblade Slinger idiom for "choose up to one": one [ModalEffect] with `chooseCount = 1,
 * minChooseCount = 0`, so declining both modes is legal and the ability leaves the stack having
 * done nothing (CR 700.2b).
 *
 * Because it is a *triggered* modal ability, the mode and its target are locked in as the ability
 * is put onto the stack (CR 603.3c) — the controller does not get to re-choose on resolution, and
 * the ability is removed from the stack if its one target has become illegal by then.
 *
 * `countsAsModalSpell` is deliberately left at its default. The flag exists for a `ModalEffect` used
 * as an implementation shortcut for a mechanic that is *not* printed as a modal (gift), and it gates
 * `SpellCastEvent.chosenModesCount` — which a triggered ability never produces. The printed wording
 * here is a genuine modal, so the default is both the faithful value and the one Assay reads back.
 *
 * Mode 2 is the Elvish Hunter rail: an ability flag with
 * [Duration.UntilAfterAffectedControllersNextUntap], keyed to the *affected* creature's controller,
 * so the effect survives until that player's next untap step rather than the Geist controller's.
