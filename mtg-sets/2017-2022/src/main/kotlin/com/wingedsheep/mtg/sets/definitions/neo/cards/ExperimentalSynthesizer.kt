/**
 * Experimental Synthesizer — Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty #138 (canonical printing)
 * {R} · Artifact
 *
 * When this artifact enters or leaves the battlefield, exile the top card of your library. Until
 * end of turn, you may play that card.
 * {2}{R}, Sacrifice this artifact: Create a 2/2 white Samurai creature token with vigilance.
 * Activate only as a sorcery.
 *
 * A one-mana artifact that impulse-draws twice — once on the way in, once on the way out — which
 * is what makes it a sacrifice payoff and an artifact-recursion payoff at the same time. Its own
 * activated ability sacrifices it, so activating it collects the leave trigger too.
 *
 * "Enters **or** leaves" is written as two triggered abilities over `Triggers.self.enters()`
 * and `Triggers.self.leaves()`. The two events can never happen at once, so one ability with a
 * two-event pattern and two abilities are the same card in play; two abilities is the shape the
 * corpus already uses for this wording (Cryogen Relic).
 *
 * Both halves are [Patterns.Exile] `.impulse(1)` — exile the top card and grant permission to play
 * it until end of turn, at its normal cost.
