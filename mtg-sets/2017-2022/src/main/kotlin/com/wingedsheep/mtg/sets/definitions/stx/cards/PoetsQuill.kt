/**
 * Poet's Quill — Strixhaven: School of Mages #82 (canonical printing)
 * {1}{B} · Artifact — Equipment
 *
 * When this Equipment enters, learn.
 * Equipped creature gets +1/+1 and has lifelink.
 * Equip {1}{B}
 *
 * The Learn is on the Equipment *entering*, not on equipping — so it happens once, when the Quill
 * is cast, and moving it between creatures later never repeats it.
 *
 * The two static riders are separate `staticAbility` blocks over [Filters.EquippedCreature]:
 * a layer-7c stat modification and a layer-6 keyword grant, which the projector applies in the
 * right order on its own (CR 613.4).
 *
 * `Learn` is [Patterns.Mechanic.learn] (CR 701.48).
