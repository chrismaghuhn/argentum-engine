 * Enchantment — Aura
 *
 * Enchant creature you control
 * When this Aura enters, draw a card.
 * Enchanted creature gets +1/+0 and has trample. (It can deal excess combat damage to the player or planeswalker it's attacking.)
 *
 * "Enchant creature you control" narrows the aura target to [Targets.CreatureYouControl]. The last
 * printed line joins a stat modification and a keyword grant with "and", which the SDK spells as two
 * separate static abilities — both default their filter to the attached creature.
