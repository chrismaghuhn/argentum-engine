/**
 * Atsushi, the Blazing Sky — Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty #134 (canonical printing)
 * {2}{R}{R} · Legendary Creature — Dragon Spirit · 4/4
 *
 * Flying, trample
 * When Atsushi dies, choose one —
 * • Exile the top two cards of your library. Until the end of your next turn, you may play those cards.
 * • Create three Treasure tokens.
 *
 * The dies trigger is a *modal* one: the mode is locked in when the trigger goes on the stack
 * (CR 603.3c), so the choice between cards and mana is made before anyone can respond. The impulse
 * half is [Patterns.Exile.impulse] with [MayPlayExpiry.UntilEndOfNextTurn], which is why the two
 * cards survive the turn Atsushi died on.
