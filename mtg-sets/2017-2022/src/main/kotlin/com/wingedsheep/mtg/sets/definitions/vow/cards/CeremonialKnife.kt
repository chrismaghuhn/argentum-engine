/**
 * Ceremonial Knife
 * {1}
 * Artifact — Equipment
 *
 * Equipped creature gets +1/+0 and has "Whenever this creature deals combat damage, create a
 * Blood token."
 * Equip {2}
 *
 * Two statics over [Filters.EquippedCreature], because the printed line grants both a stat
 * modifier (Layer 7c) and a quoted triggered ability — and a [GrantTriggeredAbility] is read by
 * `TriggerDetector` rather than projected through the layer system, so it stays in its own block
 * instead of joining a `CompositeStaticAbility`.
 *
 * The quoted trigger has no recipient: "deals combat damage" fires on combat damage to *anything*
 * — a player, a planeswalker, or a blocking/blocked creature — so it is
 * `Triggers.self.dealsCombatDamage()` with the default `Recipient.Any`, not the
 * narrower `Triggers.self.dealsCombatDamage(Recipient.AnyPlayer)`. Binding stays SELF: inside the granted ability
 * "this creature" is the equipped creature that received it, and that creature's controller is the
 * one who gets the Blood token.
