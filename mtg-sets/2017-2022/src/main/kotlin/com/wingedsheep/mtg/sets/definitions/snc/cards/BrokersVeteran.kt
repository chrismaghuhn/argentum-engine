 * When this creature dies, put a shield counter on target creature you control. (If it would be dealt damage or destroyed, remove a shield counter from it instead.)
 *
 * The shield counter is the engine's CR 122.1c counter — the reminder text's replacement +
 * prevention pair is wired at the damage and destroy chokepoints, so the card only has to put
 * the counter on.
