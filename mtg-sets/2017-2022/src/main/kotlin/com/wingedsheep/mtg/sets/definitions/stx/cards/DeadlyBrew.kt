/**
 * Deadly Brew
 * {B}{G}
 * Sorcery
 *
 * Each player sacrifices a creature or planeswalker of their choice. If you sacrificed a
 * permanent this way, you may return another permanent card from your graveyard to your
 * hand.
 *
 * Same shape as Rise of the Witch-king, with two differences: the edict filter is
 * creature-or-planeswalker (not just creature), and the reanimation half returns the
 * chosen card to hand rather than the battlefield.
 *
 * The oracle text does not say "target" — the return is a *resolution-time* choice, not a
 * cast-time target, so the spell has no targets and always resolves.
 *
 * Composition:
 *  - `Effects.Sacrifice(CreatureOrPlaneswalker, count=1, target=Player.Each)` — each player
 *    auto-sacrifices a sole eligible permanent or chooses among multiples. The snapshots
 *    flow into `EffectContext.sacrificedPermanents` so the rider can read them.
 *  - The rider is a `Effects.If` gated on `YouSacrificedThisWay`.
 *  - The recursion half is the standard Gather → Select(`ChooseUpTo(1)`) → Move pipeline
 *    against your graveyard. `excludeSacrificedThisWay = true` keeps the permanent you just
 *    sacrificed (now in your graveyard) out of the "another permanent card" choice.
