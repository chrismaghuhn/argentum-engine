/**
 * Reconnaissance Mission
 * {2}{U}{U}
 * Enchantment
 * Whenever a creature you control deals combat damage to a player, you may draw a card.
 * Cycling {2} ({2}, Discard this card: Draw a card.)
 *
 * "Whenever a creature you control deals combat damage to a player" is not a trigger on the
 * enchantment — it is an ability the enchantment *grants* to every creature you control, so it
 * fires once per creature that connects. [GrantTriggeredAbility] with a group filter is that
 * shape; the granted ability keeps the SELF binding of
 * `Triggers.self.dealsCombatDamage(Recipient.AnyPlayer)`, which resolves against whichever creature it is riding on.
 *
 * The printed "you may" is a [Effects.May] consent gate around the draw, not an `optional` flag.
