/**
 * Scrapyard Recombiner
 * {3}
 * Artifact Creature — Construct
 * 0/0
 * Modular 2 (This creature enters with two +1/+1 counters on it. When it dies, you may put its +1/+1 counters on target artifact creature.)
 * {T}, Sacrifice an artifact: Search your library for a Construct card, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle.
 *
 * **Modular is lowered here, not handled by the engine** — the same two-declaration shape
 * `mh2/cards/ArcboundMouser.kt` uses. [KeywordAbility.modular] is display-only vocabulary (nothing
 * in the rules engine reads `Keyword.MODULAR`), so the two halves the reminder text spells out are
 * wired explicitly:
 *
 *  - the ETB half is an [EntersWithCounters] replacement (`selfOnly`, two +1/+1 counters). That is
 *    why the printed box is 0/0: a Recombiner on the battlefield is a 2/2 made entirely of counters.
 *  - the death half is an *optional* dies trigger reading
 *    [ContextPropertyKey.LAST_KNOWN_PLUS_ONE_COUNTER_COUNT] rather than the live entity — the
 *    counters cease to exist the moment the Recombiner changes zones, so the count must come from
 *    last-known information (CR 603.10 / 608.2h).
 *
 * That last point is also why this uses [Effects.AddDynamicCounters] with an explicit +1/+1 count
 * rather than the neighbouring `Effects.MoveAllLastKnownCounters` shape (Servant of the Scale):
 * moving *all* last-known counters would hand the target any leftover -1/-1 counters too, and
 * modular only ever moves the +1/+1 ones.
 *
 * The tutor is the plain [Patterns.Library.searchLibrary] recipe — a bare "Construct card" is any
 * permanent card with the subtype, not a creature card, so the filter is
 * [GameObjectFilter.Permanent] narrowed by subtype.
