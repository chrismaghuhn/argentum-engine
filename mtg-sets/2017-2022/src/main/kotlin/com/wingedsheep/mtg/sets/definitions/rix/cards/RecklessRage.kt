/**
 * Reckless Rage — Rivals of Ixalan #110 (canonical printing)
 * {R} · Instant
 *
 * Reckless Rage deals 4 damage to target creature you don't control and 2 damage to target
 * creature you control.
 *
 * Two required targets with different amounts, so the spell is uncastable unless both a creature
 * you control and a creature you don't are available — that drawback is the whole cost of a
 * one-mana 4-damage removal spell, and it falls out of the targeting rules for free: a required
 * `target(...)` with no legal object makes the spell illegal to cast (CR 601.2c).
 *
 * "Creature you don't control" is modelled as [Targets.CreatureOpponentControls]. Every permanent
 * on the battlefield is controlled by some player and this engine has no teams, so the two
 * readings pick out the same set of creatures.
 *
 * Both damage sub-effects run in one [Effects.Composite] so they resolve together, and each is
 * dealt by the spell itself (no `damageSource`) — matching "Reckless Rage deals".
