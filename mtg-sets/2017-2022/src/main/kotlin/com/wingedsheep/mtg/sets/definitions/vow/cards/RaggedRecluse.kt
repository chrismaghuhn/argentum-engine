/**
 * Ragged Recluse // Odious Witch (Innistrad: Crimson Vow #127 — the card's earliest printing)
 * {1}{B} · Creature — Human Peasant 2/1 // Creature — Human Warlock 3/3
 *
 * Front — Ragged Recluse ({1}{B}, Creature — Human Peasant, 2/1)
 *   At the beginning of your end step, if you discarded a card this turn, transform this creature.
 *
 * Back — Odious Witch (Creature — Human Warlock, 3/3, black color indicator)
 *   Whenever this creature attacks, defending player loses 1 life and you gain 1 life.
 *
 * The front is Panicked Bystander's shape with a different tally: an `interveningIf` on the end-step
 * trigger, which CR 603.4 checks twice — once when the ability would trigger, and again on
 * resolution. A discard that happens in response to the trigger therefore still turns it on, and a
 * card discarded earlier in the turn keeps it on even though the hand has since refilled.
 *
 * "You discarded a card this turn" is [Conditions.YouDiscardedACardThisTurn], named in this change
 * over the turn-scoped tally `TurnTracker.CARDS_DISCARDED` — the engine's
 * `CardsDiscardedThisTurnComponent`, written by every discard site (cost, effect, cycling, hand-size
 * cleanup) and reset each turn. It counts *cards*, not discard events, which is what the printed
 * "a card" asks for: one discard of two cards satisfies it just as two discards of one do. This is
 * not an ordinary flip trigger the opponent can play around, so it is not a "may".
 *
 * The back is a plain attack drain. "Defending player" is [Player.DefendingPlayer], resolved from
 * the attack the trigger fired on rather than from targeting, so the ability targets nothing and the
 * life loss is not damage — protection, prevention and damage replacement never see it. The two
 * halves are one [Effects.Composite] because they are one printed sentence: they resolve in printed
 * order, and the life gain happens whether or not the loss did anything.
