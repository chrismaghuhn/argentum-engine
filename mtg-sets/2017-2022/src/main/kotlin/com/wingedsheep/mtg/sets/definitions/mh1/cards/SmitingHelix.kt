/**
 * Smiting Helix — Modern Horizons #109
 * {3}{B} · Sorcery
 *
 * Smiting Helix deals 3 damage to any target and you gain 3 life.
 * Flashback {R}{W}
 *
 * One of the set's off-color flashback cards: a black sorcery whose flashback cost is
 * {R}{W}, so its color identity is all three (Lightning Helix's effect, cast from the
 * graveyard on Boros mana). The flashback cost is not a second face — the card is black in
 * every zone; only the *cost* changes colors.
 *
 * "Any target" is one requirement (CR 115.4) covering creature, player, battle and planeswalker,
 * and the life gain is a separate step in the same [Effects.Composite] — it happens even if the
 * damage target has become illegal, because the whole spell only fizzles when *every* target does.
 * No `damageSource` is passed: the spell is its own source, which is the default.
