 * Champion of Dusk

 * Creature — Vampire Knight
 * 4/4
 * When this creature enters, you draw X cards and you lose X life, where X is the number of
 * Vampires you control.
 *
 * X is counted twice — once for the draw, once for the loss — because both legs read the
 * battlefield as the ability resolves; the printed line is a single count, and the two reads
 * happen back-to-back with nothing in between that could change it.
