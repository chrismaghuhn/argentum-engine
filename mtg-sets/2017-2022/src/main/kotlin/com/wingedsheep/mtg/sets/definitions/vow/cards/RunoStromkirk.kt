/**
 * Runo Stromkirk // Krothuss, Lord of the Deep — Innistrad: Crimson Vow #246
 * {1}{U}{B} · Legendary Creature — Vampire Cleric 1/4 // Legendary Creature — Kraken Horror 3/5
 *
 * Front — Runo Stromkirk
 *   Flying
 *   When Runo enters, put up to one target creature card from your graveyard on top of your
 *   library.
 *   At the beginning of your upkeep, look at the top card of your library. You may reveal that
 *   card. If a creature card with mana value 6 or greater is revealed this way, transform Runo.
 *
 * Back — Krothuss, Lord of the Deep
 *   Flying
 *   Whenever Krothuss attacks, create a tapped and attacking token that's a copy of another target
 *   attacking creature. If that creature is a Kraken, Leviathan, Octopus, or Serpent, create two of
 *   those tokens instead.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *
 *  - **The upkeep trigger is Delver of Secrets' sentence with a different filter.** Nothing moves
 *    zones — the card is looked at and stays on top whether or not it is revealed — so the pipeline
 *    is gather-only, and the "you may reveal" is a `ChooseUpTo(1)` over the looked-at collection
 *    (`showAllCards = true` makes the overlay the *look*, selecting is the *reveal*). The transform
 *    is gated on the **revealed** collection, not the looked-at one: declining to reveal a
 *    six-drop must not flip Runo, and the printed text says "revealed this way".
 *  - **"a creature card with mana value 6 or greater"** is one filter,
 *    `GameObjectFilter.Creature.manaValueAtLeast(6)`, not two clauses — the card must satisfy both
 *    to flip.
 *  - **The ETB target is `optional = true`, not a separate "you may".** "Up to one target" is a
 *    target-count shape (CR 115.2c): casting Runo with an empty graveyard is legal and the trigger
 *    simply chooses nothing. `TargetFilter.CreatureInYourGraveyard` is the same slot Retrieve uses.
 *  - **Krothuss targets "another" attacking creature**, so the requirement is wrapped in
 *    [TargetOther] — Krothuss is itself an attacking creature and would otherwise be a legal
 *    choice for its own trigger.
 *  - **The doubled count is a property of the *target*, read at resolution.**
 *    [CreateTokenCopyOfTargetEffect.count] takes a [DynamicAmount], so the "if that creature is a
 *    Kraken, Leviathan, Octopus, or Serpent" rider is `DynamicAmount.Conditional` over
 *    [Conditions.TargetMatchesFilter] at target index 0 rather than two branches of a
 *    [Effects.If] — one effect, one token template, two possible counts. The subtype test
 *    is a single `withAnySubtype` (an OR), which is what the printed comma list means.
 *  - Per its own ruling the token is *put onto the battlefield* attacking rather than declared as
 *    an attacker, which is exactly what `attacking = true` models — it emits no "attacks" trigger.
 *    The token is **not** sacrificed at end of turn: unlike Calamity, Krothuss prints no such
 *    clause, so `sacrificeAtStep` stays null.
