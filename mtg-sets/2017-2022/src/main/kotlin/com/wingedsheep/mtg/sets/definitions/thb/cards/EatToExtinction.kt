 * Exile target creature or planeswalker. Surveil 1. (Look at the top card of your library. You may
 * put that card into your graveyard.)
 *
 * [Effects.Exile] is the exile-flavoured `MoveToZone`; no `fromZone` guard, because the target is a
 * battlefield permanent chosen at cast time rather than a card fished out of another zone. The
 * surveil rider is the compact [Effects.Surveil] macro, which the engine expands to the shared
 * surveil pipeline at resolution so "whenever you surveil" triggers still see it.
