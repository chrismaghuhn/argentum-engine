/**
 * Odric, Blood-Cursed (Innistrad: Crimson Vow #243)
 * {1}{R}{W} · Legendary Creature — Vampire Soldier 3/3
 *
 * When Odric enters, create X Blood tokens, where X is the number of abilities from among flying,
 * first strike, double strike, deathtouch, haste, hexproof, indestructible, lifelink, menace,
 * reach, trample, and vigilance found among creatures you control. (Count each ability only once.)
 *
 * Implementation: the printed list is a fixed twelve keywords, so X is the sum of twelve 0/1
 * terms — `1 if you control a creature with K, otherwise 0` — folded with [DynamicAmount.Add] and
 * fed to the dynamic [Effects.CreateBlood] overload, so all X tokens are created by one effect at
 * resolution (not one at a time). "Count each ability only once" falls out of the shape: each
 * keyword contributes at most one, however many creatures carry it. The keyword filter reads
 * projected state, so granted keywords count, and Odric itself is on the battlefield when the
 * trigger resolves, so keywords it has been given count too (it has none of its own).
