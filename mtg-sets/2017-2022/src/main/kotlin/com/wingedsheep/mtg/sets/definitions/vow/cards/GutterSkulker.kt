/**
 * Gutter Skulker // Gutter Shortcut (Innistrad: Crimson Vow #62 — the card's earliest printing)
 * {3}{U} · Creature — Spirit 3/3 // Enchantment — Aura
 *
 * Front — Gutter Skulker ({3}{U}, Creature — Spirit, 3/3)
 *   This creature can't be blocked as long as it's attacking alone.
 *   Disturb {3}{U}
 *
 * Back — Gutter Shortcut (Enchantment — Aura, blue color indicator)
 *   Enchant creature
 *   Enchanted creature can't be blocked as long as it's attacking alone.
 *   If Gutter Shortcut would be put into a graveyard from anywhere, exile it instead.
 *
 * Both faces print the same evasion clause about two different creatures, which is the whole of
 * the modelling decision. [CantBeBlocked] carries the *affected* creature in its `filter`
 * (`GroupFilter.source()` on the creature face, `GroupFilter.attachedCreature()` on the Aura — the
 * type's KDoc is explicit that an attachment omitting it reads as a restriction on the Aura, which
 * never blocks or is blocked, and is therefore silently inert), and the "as long as" clause is the
 * `condition` on the same [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.ConditionalStaticAbility]: the source on
 * the front, the enchanted permanent on the back. Both condition roles are dual-mode, so they are
 * answerable during static-ability projection, which is where a continuous effect is applied.
 *
 * "Attacking alone" is CR 506.5 — [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.predicates.StatePredicate
 * .IsAttackingAlone], a live read of the current attacking set with no last-known fallback. It is
 * re-checked continuously, so a second attacker joining the attack (or the enchanted creature
 * ceasing to attack) turns the evasion off on its own.
 *
 * Disturb is CR 702.146; the exile-instead clause is [RedirectZoneChange] with `selfOnly = true` so
 * it functions from every zone (CR 614.12).
