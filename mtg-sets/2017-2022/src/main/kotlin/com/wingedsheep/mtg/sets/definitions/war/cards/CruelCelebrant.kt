/**
 * Cruel Celebrant — War of the Spark #188 (canonical printing)
 * {W}{B}
 * Creature — Vampire
 * 1/2
 * Whenever this creature or another creature or planeswalker you control dies, each opponent
 * loses 1 life and you gain 1 life.
 *
 * "This creature **or another**" is not two triggers: it is one [TriggerBinding.ANY] trigger
 * whose filter already admits the source — the same spelling [Triggers] uses for
 * `YourCreatureDies`. The only reason it goes through `Triggers.<subject>.leaves(to, excludeTo, excludeSacrifice)` rather than
 * that constant is the permanent type: Cruel Celebrant also counts planeswalkers, so the filter
 * is [GameObjectFilter.CreatureOrPlaneswalker] narrowed with `youControl()`. Spelled out at the
 * call site rather than promoted to a `Triggers` constant — there is exactly one card in the
 * corpus with this shape so far.
