/**
 * Takenuma, Abandoned Mire — Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty #278 (canonical printing)
 * Legendary Land · Rare
 *
 * {T}: Add {B}.
 * Channel — {3}{B}, Discard this card: Mill three cards, then return a creature or planeswalker
 * card from your graveyard to your hand. This ability costs {1} less to activate for each
 * legendary creature you control.
 *
 * One of the five NEO channel lands; see [OtawaraSoaringCity] for the shape they share.
 *
 * The return is **not targeted** — it is a choice made on resolution, and it is mandatory rather
 * than a "may", so it is the Gather → Select → Move pipeline with
 * [SelectionMode.ChooseExactly]. That mode clamps to what is actually there, which is the right
 * reading here: with no creature or planeswalker card in the graveyard after the mill, nothing
 * is returned and the ability simply finishes.
 *
 * Printed order matters and is preserved: the mill happens *first*, so a creature card milled by
 * this very ability is already in the graveyard and is a legal choice to return.
