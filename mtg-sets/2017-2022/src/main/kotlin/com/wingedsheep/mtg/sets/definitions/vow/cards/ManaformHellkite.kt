/**
 * Manaform Hellkite — Innistrad: Crimson Vow #170
 * {2}{R}{R} · Creature — Dragon · Mythic · 4/4
 * Artist: Andrew Mar
 *
 * Flying
 * Whenever you cast a noncreature spell, create an X/X red Dragon Illusion creature token with
 * flying and haste, where X is the amount of mana spent to cast that spell. Exile that token at
 * the beginning of the next end step.
 *
 * X is [ContextPropertyKey.MANA_SPENT_ON_TRIGGERING_SPELL] — the mana *actually paid* for the
 * triggering spell, read off `SpellCastEvent.totalManaSpent`, not that spell's printed mana value.
 * A spell cast without paying its mana cost makes a 0/0 token that dies immediately (Scryfall
 * ruling, below), which is why the amount must be the spend and not [DynamicAmount.TotalManaSpent]
 * (the *resolving* object's own cast — here, the Hellkite's).
 *
 * The end-step exile is [CreateTokenEffect.exileAtStep], the same delayed-cleanup rider Valduk,
 * Keeper of the Flame uses; it fires at the beginning of the next end step whether or not the
 * Hellkite is still on the battlefield.
