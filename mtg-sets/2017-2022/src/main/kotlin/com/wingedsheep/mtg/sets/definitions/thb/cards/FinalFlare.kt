/**
 * Final Flare

 * Instant
 *
 * As an additional cost to cast this spell, sacrifice a creature or enchantment.
 * Final Flare deals 5 damage to target creature.
 *
 * The sacrifice is an [Costs.additional] atom, not a target: it is chosen and paid while the spell
 * is being cast, so nothing can respond between the sacrifice and the spell going on the stack, and
 * the sacrificed permanent is never a legal object for the damage. [GameObjectFilter.CreatureOrEnchantment]
 * is the printed noun phrase — a creature *or* an enchantment, so an enchantment creature qualifies
 * on either half.
