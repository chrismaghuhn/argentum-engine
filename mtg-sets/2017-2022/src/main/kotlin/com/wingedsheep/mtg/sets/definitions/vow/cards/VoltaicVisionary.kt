/**
 * Voltaic Visionary // Volt-Charged Berserker (Innistrad: Crimson Vow #183)
 * {1}{R}
 * Creature — Human Wizard // Creature — Human Berserker
 *
 * Front — Voltaic Visionary (3/1)
 *   {T}: This creature deals 2 damage to you. Exile the top card of your library. You may play that
 *   card this turn. Activate only as a sorcery.
 *   When you play a card exiled with this creature, transform this creature.
 *
 * Back — Volt-Charged Berserker (4/3)
 *   This creature can't block.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *
 *  - **The two printed lines are one effect here.** "You may play that card this turn" and "When you
 *    play a card exiled with this creature, transform this creature" are the impulse-exile grant and
 *    its rider, so they collapse into [Effects.GrantMayPlayFromExile]'s `onPlayRider` (the Fires of
 *    Mount Doom shape): the engine registers a link-id-scoped delayed trigger alongside the play
 *    permission, and playing a granted card fires it *as a triggered ability of this creature*.
 *    That is exactly the printed ruling — "Voltaic Visionary will transform **before** that spell
 *    resolves", because the reflexive trigger goes on the stack above it. The rider expires with the
 *    grant at end of turn, which loses nothing: the permission itself is only good for that turn, so
 *    there is no window in which a card "exiled with this creature" is playable but unwatched.
 *  - **No `nonLandOnly`.** The card says "**play**", not "cast", so a land among the exiled cards is
 *    playable (subject to the normal one-land-per-turn rule, per the printed ruling) and playing it
 *    transforms the Visionary just the same.
 *  - **The damage is to you**, from this creature — `damageSource = Self` so lifelink/damage triggers
 *    and any "damage dealt by a source you control" reads see the right source.
 *  - "Activate only as a sorcery" is `timing = TimingRule.SorcerySpeed`.
 *  - The back face is a transformed face with no mana cost, so its colour comes from a colour
 *    indicator (CR 204): `colorIndicator = "R"`.
