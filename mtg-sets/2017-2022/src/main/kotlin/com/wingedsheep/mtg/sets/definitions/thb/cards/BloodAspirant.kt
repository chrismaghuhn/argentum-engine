/**
 * Blood Aspirant
 * {1}{R}
 * Creature — Satyr Berserker
 * 1/1
 *
 * Whenever you sacrifice a permanent, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature.
 * {1}{R}, {T}, Sacrifice a creature or enchantment: This creature deals 1 damage to target creature.
 * That creature can't block this turn.
 *
 * The trigger is `Triggers.you.sacrifices(filter)` — the *per-permanent* template (CR 603.2c), which fires
 * once for each matching permanent rather than once per batch, and whose `ANY` binding lets the
 * Satyr count itself. The two abilities interact by design: the activated ability's sacrifice is
 * paid as a **cost**, and the cost-payment paths emit `PermanentsSacrificedEvent` just like an
 * effect-driven sacrifice does, so activating the second ability grows the Satyr via the first.
 *
 * The activated ability's two clauses are one `Composite` over a single shared target — the damage
 * and the block restriction both read the same bound `target`, so this is a `then` chain and not
 * two requirements.
