/**

 * "Each Angel you already control" is the board *excluding the entering Angel* but
 * *including Giada herself* (Scryfall ruling below) — modelled as an
 * [EntersWithDynamicCounters] with `otherOnly = true` whose count is an
 * `AggregateBattlefield(excludeSelf = true)`. The global enters-with pass evaluates the count
 * with `sourceId`/`affectedEntityId` set to the *entering* permanent (the counters describe it,
 * CR 614), so `excludeSelf` drops exactly the new Angel while `Player.You` still resolves to
 * Giada's controller.
