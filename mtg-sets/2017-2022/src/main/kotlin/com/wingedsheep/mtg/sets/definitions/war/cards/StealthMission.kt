/**
 * Stealth Mission

 * Sorcery
 * Put two +1/+1 counters on target creature you control. That creature can't be blocked this turn.
 *
 * "Can't be blocked this turn" is [Effects.GrantKeyword] over
 * [AbilityFlag.CANT_BE_BLOCKED] — the same grant "gains flying until end of turn" builds. The flag
 * rather than a [com.wingedsheep.sdk.core.Keyword] because "can't be blocked" names a whole
 * sentence, not a noun a creature can be said to gain. Both halves read the one named target so
 * "that creature" is the creature the counters went on.
