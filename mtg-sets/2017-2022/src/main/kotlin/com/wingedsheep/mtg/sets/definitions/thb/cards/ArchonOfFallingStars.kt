/**
 * Archon of Falling Stars
 * {4}{W}{W}
 * Creature — Archon
 * 4/4
 *
 * Flying
 * When this creature dies, you may return target enchantment card from your graveyard to the battlefield.
 *
 * A plain `Triggers.self.dies()` — battlefield → graveyard, SELF binding, and *no* `triggerZone`: setting
 * one replaces the default `{BATTLEFIELD}` and the dies trigger would never be indexed.
 *
 * The target is an object in the graveyard, so its controller predicate reads **owner**
 * (`ownedByYou()`): a card in a graveyard has no controller. `optional = true` is the DSL's
 * shorthand for the printed "you may" and lowers to exactly `Effects.May(effect)`.
 *
 * [Effects.PutOntoBattlefieldFromGraveyard] keeps its `fromZone = GRAVEYARD` guard even though the
 * target requirement already scopes the graveyard: the requirement decides legality at
 * announcement, the guard skips the move if the card has left the graveyard by resolution.
