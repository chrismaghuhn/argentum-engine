 * Professor's Warning — Strixhaven: School of Mages #84 (canonical printing)
 * {B} · Instant

 * Choose one —
 * • Put a +1/+1 counter on target creature.
 * • Target creature gains indestructible until end of turn. (Damage and effects that say "destroy" don't destroy it.)
 *
 * A choose-one modal (the Valorous Stance shape) where each mode carries its own creature target:
 * the first is [Effects.AddCounters] of a single +1/+1 counter, the second [Effects.GrantKeyword]
 * of indestructible with the default until-end-of-turn duration.
