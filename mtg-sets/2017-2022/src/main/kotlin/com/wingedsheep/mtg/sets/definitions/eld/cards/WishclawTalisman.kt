/**
 * Wishclaw Talisman
 * {1}{B}
 * Artifact
 * This artifact enters with three wish counters on it.
 * {1}, {T}, Remove a wish counter from this artifact: Search your library for a card, put it into
 *   your hand, then shuffle. An opponent gains control of this artifact. Activate only during your turn.
 *
 * Modelling notes:
 * - "Enters with three wish counters" is a replacement effect (CR 614.1c), not an ETB trigger, so it
 *   is an [EntersWithCounters] with `selfOnly = true`.
 * - The wish counters *are* the use limit: once they run out the Talisman just sits on the
 *   battlefield with an unactivatable ability (Scryfall ruling), which falls out of the cost being
 *   unpayable — no extra gate needed.
 * - "An opponent gains control" is not targeted; the controller picks while the ability resolves
 *   (Scryfall ruling), so [Effects.ChooseOpponent] records the pick on the source and
 *   [GiveControlToTargetPlayerEffect] reads it back through [Player.ChosenOpponent]. In a two-player
 *   game the pick is forced, so no extra decision is surfaced.
