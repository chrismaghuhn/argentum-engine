/**
 * Sigarda's Summons
 * {4}{W}{W}
 * Enchantment
 *
 * Creatures you control with +1/+1 counters on them have base power and toughness 4/4, have
 * flying, and are Angels in addition to their other types.
 *
 * One printed ability spanning three layers — Layer 4 (the Angel subtype), Layer 6 (flying) and
 * Layer 7b (base P/T) — so it is a single [CompositeStaticAbility] rather than three
 * `staticAbility { }` blocks (CR 613.6, the Archon of the Wild Rose shape). Split into three
 * blocks the engine would treat each layer as its own effect and re-resolve the affected set per
 * layer; bundled, the set is locked once and every layer applies to that same set.
 *
 * [GrantSubtype] defaults its filter to the *source*, so the shared filter must be passed
 * explicitly here or the enchantment would quietly make itself an Angel.
 *
 * The +1/+1 counters themselves still apply on top: they are Layer 7d, above the 7b base-P/T set,
 * so a 1/1 with two counters ends up 6/6 rather than 4/4. And because the filter reads counters
 * live, removing the last counter (or the enchantment leaving) reverts the creature mid-combat,
 * which is exactly what the printed ruling describes.
