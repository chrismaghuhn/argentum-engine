 * Triton Waverider

 * Creature — Merfolk Wizard
 * 3/3

 *
 * Constellation is an ability word with no rules meaning of its own — a plain enters-the-battlefield
 * watcher over enchantments you control, bound with [TriggerBinding.ANY] because the Waverider is
 * not the permanent being watched. Same shape as Favored of Iroas, with flying in place of double
 * strike.
