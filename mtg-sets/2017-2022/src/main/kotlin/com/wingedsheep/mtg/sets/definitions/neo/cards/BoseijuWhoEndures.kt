/**
 * Boseiju, Who Endures — Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty #266 (canonical printing)
 * Legendary Land · Rare
 *
 * {T}: Add {G}.
 * Channel — {1}{G}, Discard this card: Destroy target artifact, enchantment, or nonbasic land an
 * opponent controls. That player may search their library for a land card with a basic land type,
 * put it onto the battlefield, then shuffle. This ability costs {1} less to activate for each
 * legendary creature you control.
 *
 * One of the five NEO channel lands; see [OtawaraSoaringCity] for the shape they share.
 *
 * The consolation fetch is the Assassin's Trophy shape: it belongs to the *destroyed permanent's*
 * controller, not to you, so it runs under [Effects.ForEachPlayer] with [Player.ControllerOf] —
 * that rebinds `Player.You` inside the search to that player, which is what makes
 * [Patterns.Library.searchLibrary] (hard-wired to `Player.You`) read the right library. Two
 * consequences fall out of the ordering rather than needing a gate: an indestructible target
 * still hands its controller the land, and declining the search skips the shuffle with it.
 *
 * "A land card **with a basic land type**" is deliberately not "a basic land card" — a shockland
 * (`Land — Forest Island`) or Dryad Arbor qualifies and a basic is merely the common case. Hence
 * [GameObjectFilter.LandWithBasicLandType] rather than [GameObjectFilter.BasicLand].
