/**
 * Olivia, Crimson Bride
 * {4}{B}{R}
 * Legendary Creature — Vampire Noble
 * 3/4
 *
 * Flying, haste
 * Whenever Olivia attacks, return target creature card from your graveyard to the battlefield
 * tapped and attacking. It gains "When you don't control a legendary Vampire, exile this creature."
 *
 * The rider is a **state-triggered ability** (CR 603.8), not an event trigger: nothing *happens*
 * when the last legendary Vampire leaves — the reanimated creature's condition simply starts being
 * true, and the check is a poll at every priority pass. That is why this card grants a
 * [StateTriggeredAbility] via [GrantStateTriggeredAbilityEffect] rather than a `TriggeredAbility`:
 * a "whenever Olivia dies" trigger would be wrong three ways (Olivia leaving the battlefield by
 * exile or bounce fires nothing, a *second* legendary Vampire on board should keep the creature
 * alive, and the rider has to keep working for the rest of the game, not just this turn).
 *
 * Two details the ordering and the filter carry:
 *
 *  - **The grant follows the Move.** `ZoneTransitionService` wipes an entity's granted abilities on
 *    battlefield entry (CR 400.7 — the returning card is a new object), so granting before the
 *    return would silently drop the rider. The `Effects.Composite` order is load-bearing.
 *  - **No `excludeSelf` on the condition.** A reanimated legendary Vampire sees *itself*, so Olivia
 *    bringing back, say, another legendary Vampire leaves it self-sustaining once Olivia is gone —
 *    which is what the printed wording says.
 *
 * The grant is [Duration.Permanent]: the rider is a durable property of the returned creature, and
 * the printed text names no end point.
