/**
 * Hengegate Pathway // Mistgate Pathway — Kaldheim #260 (canonical printing)
 * Land // Land · Modal double-faced card
 *
 * Front — Hengegate Pathway: "{T}: Add {W}."
 * Back  — Mistgate Pathway: "{T}: Add {U}."
 *
 * One of the ten Pathways. Per CR 712.12 the card is played as a land with one of its faces
 * chosen on the way in, and it enters with that face up — so this is two mutually exclusive
 * land plays off a single card, not a dual land. The choice is final: CR 712.9 excludes modal
 * DFCs from transforming. See `RiverglidePathway` (Zendikar Rising) for the full note on how the
 * cycle is modelled.
