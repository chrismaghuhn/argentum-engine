/**
 * Farfinder
 * {3}
 * Creature — Fox
 * 1/1
 * Vigilance
 * When this creature enters, you may search your library for a basic land card, reveal it, put it
 * into your hand, then shuffle.
 *
 * `optional = true` lowers to the CR 601-style consent gate around the whole search, so a
 * controller who declines never opens the library — which matters, because searching is a public
 * act (CR 701.23) and the recipe emits the "a player searched their library" event either way.
