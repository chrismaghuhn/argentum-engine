/**
 * Diamond Mare
 * {2}
 * Artifact Creature — Horse
 * 1/3
 *
 * As this creature enters, choose a color.
 * Whenever you cast a spell of the chosen color, you gain 1 life.
 *
 * The color is stored at ETB via [EntersWithChoice] (ChoiceType.COLOR →
 * CastChoicesComponent), the same primitive Teferi's Moat / Harsh Judgment use.
 * The lifegain trigger is a `youCastSpell` filtered by
 * [GameObjectFilter.sharingChosenColorWithSource] — the spell must include the color
 * stored on this permanent (CardPredicate.SharesChosenColorWithSource reads the trigger
 * source's chosen color). Any spell of that color qualifies, so no type restriction.
 *
 * Canonical printing lives here (Core Set 2019, the earliest real printing); later
 * sets (Foundations, …) contribute only [com.wingedsheep.sdk.model.Printing] rows.
