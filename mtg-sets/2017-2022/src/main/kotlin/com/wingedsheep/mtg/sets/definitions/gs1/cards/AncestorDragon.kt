/**
 * Ancestor Dragon — Global Series: Jiang Yanggu & Mu Yanling #12 (canonical printing; reprinted
 * in Foundations #489).
 * {4}{W}{W} · Creature — Dragon · 5/6
 *
 * Flying.
 * Whenever one or more creatures you control attack, you gain 1 life for each attacking creature.
 *
 * The second ability is a single batch trigger (CR 508.3) that fires once per combat no matter how
 * many creatures attack, and gains life equal to the number of attacking creatures you control at
 * resolution — the same shape as Grand Warlord Radha, gaining life instead of mana.
