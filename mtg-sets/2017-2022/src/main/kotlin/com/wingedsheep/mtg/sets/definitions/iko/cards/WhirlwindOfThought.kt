 * `Triggers.you.casts(GameObjectFilter.Noncreature)` already carries both halves of the sentence — the
 * `GameObjectFilter.Noncreature` spell filter and `Player.You` — so the trigger needs no extra
 * scoping. It fires on *cast*, not on resolution: the card is drawn even if the spell that caused
 * it is countered, and the draw trigger goes on the stack above the spell.
