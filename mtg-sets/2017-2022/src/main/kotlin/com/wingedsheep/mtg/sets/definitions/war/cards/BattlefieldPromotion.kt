/**
 * Battlefield Promotion
 * {1}{W}
 * Instant
 * Put a +1/+1 counter on target creature. That creature gains first strike until end of turn. You gain 2 life. (A creature with first strike deals combat damage before creatures without first strike.)
 *
 * All three halves resolve off one named target, so "that creature" is the creature the counter
 * went on. The counter is permanent; the first strike is a [Effects.GrantKeyword] that expires at
 * end of turn (the facade's default duration). The lifegain has no target — it is always the
 * controller.
