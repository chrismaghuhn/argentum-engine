/**
 * Sorin the Mirthless — Innistrad: Crimson Vow #131
 * {2}{B}{B} · Legendary Planeswalker — Sorin · Mythic · Starting loyalty 4
 *
 * +1: Look at the top card of your library. You may reveal that card and put it into your hand.
 *     If you do, you lose life equal to its mana value.
 * −2: Create a 2/3 black Vampire creature token with flying and lifelink.
 * −7: Sorin deals 13 damage to any target. You gain 13 life.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *
 *  - **The +1 is the [Patterns.Library.lookAtTopRevealMatchingToHand] sentence with the "rest"
 *    destination moved back to the *top* of the library.** The printed ruling is explicit: "If you
 *    choose not to reveal the card you looked at with Sorin's first loyalty ability, it stays on
 *    top of your library" — so the declined card goes to `ZonePlacement.Top` (and
 *    `CardOrder.Preserve`, though a one-card pile makes the order moot) rather than the recipe's
 *    default bottom. The filter is [GameObjectFilter.Any]: *any* card may be revealed, so the
 *    choice is purely "do I want it at this life cost", not a type test.
 *  - **"If you do" is a fold over the pipeline's own output, not a second decision.** The recipe
 *    stores the taken card in the `kept` collection, so the life loss is a
 *    [ConditionalOnCollectionEffect] over `kept` — declining the reveal leaves it empty and no
 *    life-loss event is emitted at all (rather than a cosmetic "lose 0 life"). The amount reads
 *    that same collection through [DynamicAmount.StoredCardManaValue], which reads the *first* card
 *    of the collection — "the mana value of **that** card" — the same amount Darkstar Augur uses for
 *    the mandatory version of this sentence. The entity-id read survives the card's move to hand.
 *  - **The −7 targets** ("any target" — creature, player, planeswalker or battle), and the life
 *    gain is unconditional: it is a separate sentence, not an "if you do" rider, so Sorin's
 *    controller gains 13 even if the damage is prevented.
