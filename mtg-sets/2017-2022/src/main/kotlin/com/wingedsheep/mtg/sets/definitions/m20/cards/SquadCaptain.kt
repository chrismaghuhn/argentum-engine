/**
 * Squad Captain
 * {4}{W}
 * Creature — Human Soldier
 * 2/2
 * Vigilance (Attacking doesn't cause this creature to tap.)
 * This creature enters with a +1/+1 counter on it for each other creature you control.
 *
 * "Other" is `AggregateBattlefield.excludeSelf` — a field on the tally, not a filter predicate —
 * so the Captain never counts itself as it enters.
 *
 * This card was a `mtgish-tooling` render that nobody had reviewed, and it counted
 * `Creature.attacking()` with no `excludeSelf`: on a main-phase cast nothing is attacking, so it
 * entered as a plain 2/2 every time. Argentum Assay's differential found it on the day the
 * counters-per-count rule made the line comparable.
