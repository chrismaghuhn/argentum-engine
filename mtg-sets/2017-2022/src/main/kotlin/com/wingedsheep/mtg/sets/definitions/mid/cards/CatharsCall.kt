 * Cathar's Call

 * Enchantment — Aura
 * Enchant creature
 * Enchanted creature has vigilance and "At the beginning of your end step, create a 1/1 white
 * Human creature token."
 *
 * The vigilance grant is a plain [GrantKeyword] over the enchanted creature. The quoted ability is
 * granted TO the enchanted creature via [GrantTriggeredAbility] (default attached-creature filter),
 * so "your end step" and the token's controller resolve against the enchanted creature's
 * controller (correct even when enchanting an opponent's creature) — the Combat Research shape.
