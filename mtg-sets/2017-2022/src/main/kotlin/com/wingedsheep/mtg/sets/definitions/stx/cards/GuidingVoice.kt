/**
 * Guiding Voice — Strixhaven: School of Mages #19 (canonical printing)
 * {W} · Sorcery
 *
 * Put a +1/+1 counter on target creature.
 * Learn.
 *
 * The counter is not optional and not restricted to your own creatures — "target creature",
 * so it can be handed to an opponent's, which matters only as a rules detail here.
 *
 * `Learn` is [Patterns.Mechanic.learn] (CR 701.48). The clauses resolve in printed order, so the
 * Learn happens after the counter regardless of whether the creature is still there.
