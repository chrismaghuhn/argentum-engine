/**
 * Stonebound Mentor — Strixhaven: School of Mages #239 (canonical printing)
 * {1}{R}{W} · Creature — Spirit Advisor · 3/3
 *
 * Whenever one or more cards leave your graveyard, scry 1.
 *
 * "One or more … leave" is CR 603.2c batch wording, so the batching
 * `Triggers.oneOrMore(filter).leaveYourGraveyard()` is the right shape: a mass reanimation or a graveyard-exiling
 * sweep fires this exactly once. The payoff is a bare [Effects.Scry].
