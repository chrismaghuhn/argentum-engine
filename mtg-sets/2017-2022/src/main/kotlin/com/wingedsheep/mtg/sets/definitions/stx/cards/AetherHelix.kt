/**
 * Aether Helix — Strixhaven: School of Mages #162 (canonical printing)
 * {3}{G}{U} · Sorcery
 *
 * Return target permanent to its owner's hand. Return target permanent card from your graveyard to your hand.
 *
 * Two independent targets, each bounced by [Effects.ReturnToHand] in printed order: the first is
 * any permanent on the battlefield ([Targets.Permanent]), the second is the Nature's Spiral shape —
 * a permanent card you own, zoned to your graveyard. Both are required targets, so the spell needs
 * a legal choice for each to be cast (CR 601.2c).
