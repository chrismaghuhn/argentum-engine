/**
 * Vampire Slayer — Innistrad: Crimson Vow #43
 * {1}{W} · Creature — Human Soldier · 2/2
 *
 * Whenever this creature deals damage to a Vampire, destroy that creature.
 *
 * The East-Mark Cavalier shape with the subtype swapped: a SELF-bound
 * `Triggers.<subject>.dealsDamage(to, damageType, requireExcess, batch, requires)` whose recipient is a [Recipient.Object] over Vampire permanents.
 * The default `damageType` is `Any`, which is what the printed text says — combat damage in the
 * usual case, but also the damage from a fight or a "this creature deals damage to target
 * creature" ability. `EffectTarget.TriggeringEntity` on a recipient-filtered damage trigger is the
 * *damaged* permanent, so "that creature" needs no targeting clause of its own.
 *
 * The filter is `Permanent.withSubtype`, not `Creature.withSubtype`: a bare creature-type noun names
 * every permanent with the subtype and the adjectival "Vampire creature" is what would narrow it
 * (Zombie Master prints both lines to make the distinction). Here the two select the same objects —
 * only creatures, planeswalkers, battles and players are ever dealt damage — but the spelling is the
 * one the corpus settled on, and it is what Assay reads the sentence as.
 *
 * Destroy rather than a damage rider means it kills a Vampire whose toughness the 2 damage never
 * threatened — and, being a destroy, it is stopped by indestructible and by regeneration.
