/**
 * Curse of Hospitality
 * {2}{R}
 * Enchantment — Aura Curse
 * Enchant player
 * Creatures attacking enchanted player have trample.
 * Whenever a creature deals combat damage to enchanted player, that player exiles the top card of
 * their library. Until end of turn, that creature's controller may play that card and they may
 * spend mana as though it were mana of any color to cast that spell.
 *
 * A player-enchanting Aura ([Targets.Player], as Grievous Wound), and the first card whose payoffs
 * are scoped by *who the Aura enchants* rather than by who controls it. Both halves needed one new
 * attachment-scoped filter, because every existing "attacking / dealt damage to" scope in the SDK
 * resolves its player against the ability's **controller** — which for a curse is exactly the wrong
 * player, and would let a curse on one opponent fire off damage dealt to another.
 *
 *  - **"Creatures attacking enchanted player have trample"** is
 *    [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.predicates.StatePredicate.IsAttackingEnchantedPlayer], the
 *    attachment-scoped sibling of `IsAttackingAnOpponent` (Oviya, Automech Artisan's "each creature
 *    that's attacking one of your opponents has trample" — the same [GrantKeyword] shape, one scope
 *    over). It is deliberately **not** "attacking creatures you control": the grant follows the
 *    *defender*, so a creature an opponent controls that's attacking the cursed player gets trample
 *    too, and a creature attacking a planeswalker the cursed player controls does not.
 *
 *  - **The damage trigger** is an ANY-bound observer with
 *    [Recipient.EnchantedPlayer] and `sourceFilter = Creature`, the shape Gonti, Night
 *    Minister uses for the same "creature deals combat damage to a player, *its controller* may play
 *    the exiled card" text. The source filter is what makes the engine bind the *damaging creature*
 *    as the triggering entity and the *damaged player* as the triggering player — the exact pair the
 *    text needs, since the card comes off the cursed player's library while the permission goes to
 *    [EffectTarget.ControllerOfTriggeringEntity].
 *
 * Per its own ruling the trigger fires **once for each creature** that connected, so it is a plain
 * per-event observer, never a `batch = true` one.
 *
 * The exile is face up and public, so the gather takes [LookAudience.None]: a look overlay would
 * show the card to the Curse's controller, who is not necessarily the player who gets to play it.
