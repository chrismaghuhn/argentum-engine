/**
 * Garna, Bloodfist of Keld
 * {1}{B}{R}{R}
 * Legendary Creature — Human Berserker
 * 4/3
 *
 * Whenever another creature you control dies, draw a card if it was attacking.
 * Otherwise, Garna deals 1 damage to each opponent.
 *
 * One trigger, one branch: the two clauses are mutually exclusive halves of a single ability, so
 * this is a [Effects.If] on the dying creature's combat status rather than two triggers
 * with mirrored intervening-if clauses (which would each check at both trigger and resolution
 * time, CR 603.4, and could diverge).
 *
 * "It was attacking" is last-known information (CR 608.2h): by the time the ability resolves the
 * creature is in the graveyard and its `AttackingComponent` has been torn down by the battlefield
 * exit. `StatePredicate.IsAttacking` (via `GameObjectFilter.attacking()`) reads the frozen
 * `EntitySnapshot.wasAttacking` for an entity that has left the battlefield, so the branch sees
 * the creature as it last existed. The filter is left unrestricted (`Any`) because the trigger
 * has already scoped the event to creatures you control — re-asserting `Creature` here would
 * re-derive a type from a projection that no longer covers the dead permanent.
