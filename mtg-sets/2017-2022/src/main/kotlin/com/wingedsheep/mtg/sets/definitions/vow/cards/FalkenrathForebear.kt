 * Falkenrath Forebear

 * Creature — Vampire
 * 3/1
 *
 * Flying
 * This creature can't block.
 * Whenever this creature deals combat damage to a player, create a Blood token.
 * {B}, Sacrifice two Blood tokens: Return this card from your graveyard to the battlefield.
 *
 * The recursion ability activates from the graveyard (like Persistent Specimen):
 * [Effects.PutOntoBattlefieldFromGraveyard] on Self, its cost combining {B} with sacrificing two
 * Blood tokens ([Costs.SacrificeMultiple] over the Blood-artifact filter). The guarded facade, not
 * the bare [Effects.PutOntoBattlefield]: "return this card **from your graveyard**" is skipped if
 * the card has left the graveyard by resolution, and the unguarded move would return it from
 * wherever it had got to. Argentum Assay's differential is what named the omission.
