/**
 * Channeler Initiate
 * {1}{G}
 * Creature — Human Druid
 * 3/4
 * When this creature enters, put three -1/-1 counters on target creature you control.
 * {T}, Remove a -1/-1 counter from this creature: Add one mana of any color.
 *
 * The three counters are an ordinary *targeted* enters trigger, not an enters-with-counters
 * replacement — the printed line lets them land on any creature you control, and Channeler
 * Initiate itself is only the usual choice. Removing one to pay the mana ability grows the
 * body back, so the counters are the ability's fuel rather than a fixed drawback.
