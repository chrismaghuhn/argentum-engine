 * Chainwhip Cyclops — War of the Spark #118 (canonical printing)
 * {4}{R}
 * Creature — Cyclops Warrior
 * 4 / 4
 * {3}{R}: Target creature can't block this turn.
 *
 * The Hall Monitor shape without the tap: a bare [Costs.Mana] and [Effects.CantBlock] over the
 * single bound creature target, whose duration defaults to end of turn. Nothing restricts whose
 * creature it may be, so the plain [Targets.Creature] requirement is correct — the whip is just as
 * happy keeping your own blocker out of the way.
