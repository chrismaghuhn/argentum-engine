 * Creature — Vedalken Ninja
 * 2/3
 * Ninjutsu {U}{B} ({U}{B}, Return an unblocked attacker you control to hand: Put this card onto the battlefield from your hand tapped and attacking.)
 * Whenever a Ninja you control deals combat damage to a player, draw a card.
 *
 * The second line is a *lord-shaped* grant, not a trigger of this creature's own: every Ninja you
 * control — this one included — has "whenever this deals combat damage to a player, draw a card",
 * so it fires once per Ninja that connects. [GrantTriggeredAbility] over a battlefield-scoped
 * [GroupFilter] is how `TriggerDetector` sees that.
