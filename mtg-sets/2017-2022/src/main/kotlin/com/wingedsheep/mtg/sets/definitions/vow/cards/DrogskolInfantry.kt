/**
 * Drogskol Infantry // Drogskol Armaments (Innistrad: Crimson Vow #10 — the card's earliest
 * printing)
 * {1}{W} · Creature — Spirit Soldier 2/2 // Enchantment — Aura
 *
 * Front — Drogskol Infantry ({1}{W}, Creature — Spirit Soldier, 2/2)
 *   Disturb {3}{W}
 *
 * Back — Drogskol Armaments (Enchantment — Aura, white color indicator)
 *   Enchant creature
 *   Enchanted creature gets +2/+2.
 *   If Drogskol Armaments would be put into a graveyard from anywhere, exile it instead.
 *
 * Implementation: the plainest member of the disturb-Aura cycle (CR 702.146) — a vanilla front face
 * whose only ability is disturb, and a back face that is one [ModifyStats] static. The disturb cast
 * puts the card on the stack back face up (CR 712.8c), so it is an Aura spell and what it enchants
 * comes from the back face's `auraTarget`. The exile-instead clause is [RedirectZoneChange] with
 * `selfOnly = true` so it functions in every zone (CR 614.12).
