/**
 * Crawling Barrens — ZNR #262
 * Land — Rare
 *
 * {T}: Add {C}.
 * {4}: Put two +1/+1 counters on this land. Then you may have it become a 0/0 Elemental
 *   creature until end of turn. It's still a land.
 *
 * The counters go on *first* and stay on the permanent even while it isn't a creature
 * (per the ZNR rulings), so the animate half never produces a 0/0 that dies to state-based
 * actions — by the time it is a creature it already has at least two +1/+1 counters.
 * [Effects.BecomeCreature] is additive in Layer 4, so the Land type is preserved
 * ("It's still a land"). The animate half is a genuine "may": the counters are placed even
 * if the player declines.
