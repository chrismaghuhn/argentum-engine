/**
 * Survivors' Bond
 * {1}{G}
 * Sorcery
 *
 * Choose one or both —
 * • Return target Human creature card from your graveyard to your hand.
 * • Return target non-Human creature card from your graveyard to your hand.
 *
 * "Choose one or both" is `modal(chooseCount = 2, minChooseCount = 1)` — `chooseCount` is the
 * ceiling and `minChooseCount` the floor (CR 700.2). The two modes are deliberately disjoint:
 * `Human` vs `non-Human` is `HasSubtype` against `NotSubtype` on the same creature-card filter, so
 * taking both modes always recurs two different cards.
 *
 * Ownership, not control, is the axis on both filters: a card in a graveyard is neither a permanent
 * nor a spell, so it has no controller — only the owner whose graveyard it sits in.
