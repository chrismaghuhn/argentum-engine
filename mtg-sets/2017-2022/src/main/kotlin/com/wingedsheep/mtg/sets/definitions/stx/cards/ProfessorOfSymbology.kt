/**
 * Professor of Symbology — Strixhaven: School of Mages #24 (canonical printing)
 * {1}{W} · Creature — Kor Cleric · 2/1
 *
 * When this creature enters, learn.
 *
 * The plainest Learn card in the set: a vanilla body whose whole text is the keyword action,
 * which makes it the reference shape for [Patterns.Mechanic.learn] on an ETB trigger.
 *
 * `Learn` is [Patterns.Mechanic.learn] (CR 701.48) — the discard is offered first and taking it
 * forecloses the Lesson, so this is *not* a choose-one.
