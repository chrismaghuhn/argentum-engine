/**
 * Plaguecrafter
 * {2}{B}
 * Creature — Human Shaman
 * 3/2
 * When this creature enters, each player sacrifices a creature or planeswalker of their choice.
 * Each player who can't discards a card.
 *
 * The sacrifice instruction is mandatory. [Effects.IfYouDo] with
 * [SuccessCriterion.PermanentsSacrificed] makes the discard a true fallback: it is not offered as
 * an alternate choice while the player can legally sacrifice, and it also covers a sacrifice that
 * an effect makes impossible (Sigarda, Host of Herons), which "controls no creature or
 * planeswalker" alone would miss. Plaguecrafter itself is a legal sacrifice.
