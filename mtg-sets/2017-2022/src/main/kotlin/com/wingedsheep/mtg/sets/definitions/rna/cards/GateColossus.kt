/**
 * Gate Colossus — RNA #232
 * Artifact Creature — Construct (8/8), Uncommon
 *
 * Affinity for Gates (This spell costs {1} less to cast for each Gate you control.)
 * This creature can't be blocked by creatures with power 2 or less.
 * Whenever a Gate you control enters, you may put this card from your graveyard on top of
 *   your library.
 *
 * The recursion trigger functions from the graveyard (`triggerZone = Zone.GRAVEYARD`) — it is
 * the card in the graveyard that sees a Gate enter and offers to go on top of the library.
 * Binding is ANY rather than OTHER because the source is never itself the entering Gate.
