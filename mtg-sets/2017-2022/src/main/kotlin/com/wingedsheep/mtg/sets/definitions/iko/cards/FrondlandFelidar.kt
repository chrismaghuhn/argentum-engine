/**
 * Frondland Felidar
 * {2}{G}{W}
 * Creature — Cat Beast
 * 3/5
 * Vigilance
 * Creatures you control with vigilance have "{1}, {T}: Tap target creature."
 *
 * A lord-shaped [GrantActivatedAbility]: the granted ability lives on each matching creature, so
 * its {T} taps *that* creature and it answers to that creature's own summoning sickness. The
 * Felidar grants to itself too — its printed vigilance puts it inside its own filter — and
 * vigilance is what makes the pair work, since an attacker that stays untapped can still tap for
 * the ability afterwards. The filter is re-read live, so a creature that gains or loses vigilance
 * gains or loses the ability with it.
