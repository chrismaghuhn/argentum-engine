/**
 * Assassin's Trophy
 * {B}{G}
 * Instant
 *
 * Destroy target permanent an opponent controls. Its controller may search their library for a
 * basic land card, put it onto the battlefield, then shuffle.
 *
 * Canonical printing is Guilds of Ravnica (GRN #152); Murders at Karlov Manor carries only a
 * [com.wingedsheep.sdk.model.Printing] row.
 *
 * The Volatile Fault / Demolition Field shape, widened from "nonbasic land" to *any* permanent an
 * opponent controls. The consolation fetch belongs to the destroyed permanent's controller, not to
 * the caster, so it runs under [Effects.ForEachPlayer] with [Player.ControllerOf] — that rebinds
 * `Player.You` inside the search to that player, which is what makes
 * [Patterns.Library.searchLibrary] (hard-wired to `Player.You`) read the right library.
 *
 * Two printed rulings fall out of the ordering rather than needing a gate of their own:
 * the fetch is *not* conditional on the destruction actually happening, so an indestructible
 * target still hands its controller the basic land; and because the spell fizzles wholesale on an
 * illegal target, no player searches in that case. The [Effects.May] wrapper carries the third —
 * declining the search skips the shuffle with it, since `shuffleAfter` lives inside the search
 * pipeline that never runs.
