 * 3/3
 *
 * Deathtouch (Any amount of damage this deals to a creature is enough to destroy it.)
 * When this creature enters, mill three cards. (Put the top three cards of your library into your graveyard.)

 * A self-mill: [Patterns.Library.mill] with its default controller scope, so the gather and the
 * move both read `Player.You`. The single printed clause means the recipe's own composite is the
 * trigger's whole effect — no outer wrapper.
