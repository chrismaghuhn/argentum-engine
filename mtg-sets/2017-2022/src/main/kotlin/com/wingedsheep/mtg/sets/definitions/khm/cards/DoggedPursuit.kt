 * Dogged Pursuit

 * Enchantment
 * At the beginning of your end step, each opponent loses 1 life and you gain 1 life.
 *
 * A drain-on-a-stick enchantment. The two halves are separate effects rather than a single drain
 * so that the life loss reaches every opponent ([Player.EachOpponent]) while the gain stays fixed
 * at 1 for the controller — a multiplayer game drains each opponent but still gains only 1.
