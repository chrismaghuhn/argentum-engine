 * Cartographer's Survey

 *
 * Look at the top seven cards of your library. Put up to two land cards from among them onto the

 *
 * `Patterns.Library.lookAtTopAndTakeMatching` is this sentence, parameter for parameter: privately
 * look at the top seven, let the caster put *up to two* land cards among them onto the battlefield
 * tapped ([SelectionMode.ChooseUpTo] filtered to [Filters.Land]; the recipe shows every looked-at
 * card and only the lands are selectable), and put the remainder on the bottom of the library in a
 * random order ([CardOrder.Random]). The card used to restate those four steps by hand.
