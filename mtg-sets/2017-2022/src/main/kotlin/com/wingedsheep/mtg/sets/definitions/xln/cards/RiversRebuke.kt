/**
 * River's Rebuke
 * {4}{U}{U}
 * Sorcery
 * Return all nonland permanents target player controls to their owner's hand.
 *
 * Targets a player ([Targets.Player] — either player, including the caster), then bounces every
 * nonland permanent that player *controls* back to its owner's hand. The controller-axis match is
 * [GameObjectFilter.targetPlayerControls], reading `context.targetPlayerId`; because
 * [Patterns.Group.returnAllToHand] gathers with `BattlefieldMatching(player = Player.Each)` and the
 * move routes each card to its owner's hand, a permanent the target controls but another player owns
 * is still returned to its rightful owner (not the target).
