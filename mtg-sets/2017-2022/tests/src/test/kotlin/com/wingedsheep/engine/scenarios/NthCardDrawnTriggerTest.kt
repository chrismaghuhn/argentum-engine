/**
 * Tests for the [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.EventPattern.NthCardDrawnEvent] trigger
 * primitive (draw analogue of NthSpellCast).
 *
 * CR 121.2: cards are drawn one at a time. A single multi-card draw fires the
 * "Nth card drawn" trigger at most once — only the one draw whose ordinal equals N.
 * CR 121.5: putting a card into a player's hand without the word "draw" does not
 * count as a draw and does not advance the per-turn count.
 *
 * The test card is a vanilla creature that gains 1 life on the trigger, used as
 * a witness for whether the trigger fired and how many times.
