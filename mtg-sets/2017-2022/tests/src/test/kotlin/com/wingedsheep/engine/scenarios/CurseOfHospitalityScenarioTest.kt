/**
 * Curse of Hospitality (VOW #152) — {2}{R} Enchantment — Aura Curse.
 *
 * "Enchant player
 *  Creatures attacking enchanted player have trample.
 *  Whenever a creature deals combat damage to enchanted player, that player exiles the top card of
 *  their library. Until end of turn, that creature's controller may play that card and they may
 *  spend mana as though it were mana of any color to cast that spell."
 *
 * Both new pieces of vocabulary here scope a *player* by the source Aura's **attachment**, where
 * every pre-existing sibling scopes it by the ability's **controller** —
 * `StatePredicate.IsAttackingEnchantedPlayer` for the static and `Recipient.EnchantedPlayer`
 * for the trigger. The self-curse test below is what separates the two readings: with the Curse on
 * its own controller, a controller-scoped predicate goes quiet and an attachment-scoped one fires.
