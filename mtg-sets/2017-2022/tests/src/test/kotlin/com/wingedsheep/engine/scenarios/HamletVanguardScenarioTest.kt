/**
 * Hamlet Vanguard (VOW #201) — {2}{G} Creature — Human Warrior, 1/1.
 *
 * "Ward {2}
 *  This creature enters with two +1/+1 counters on it for each other nontoken Human you control."
 *
 * Three things about the count are worth proving rather than assuming, because each is a place the
 * card could be silently off:
 *
 *  1. **The rate.** The printed "two … for each" is a `Multiply` over the tally, not a second count,
 *     so two other Humans is four counters and not two.
 *  2. **"Other".** The Vanguard is itself a Human, and the count is evaluated as it enters — so
 *     `AggregateBattlefield.excludeSelf` has to drop exactly it. A board with no other Humans must
 *     leave a plain 1/1.
 *  3. **"Nontoken".** A Human *token* pays nothing, which is the whole reason the filter carries
 *     `nontoken()`; Join the Dance supplies two of them.
 *
 * P/T is read through projected state — a +1/+1 counter turns the 1/1 into a 2/2 there, and the card
 * carries no other continuous effect, so the projected numbers are the counter count plus one.
