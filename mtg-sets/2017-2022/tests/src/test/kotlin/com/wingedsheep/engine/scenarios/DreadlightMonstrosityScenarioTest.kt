/**
 * Dreadlight Monstrosity (VOW #57) — {4}{U}{U} Creature — Crab Horror, 5/5.
 *
 * "Ward {2}
 *  {3}{U}{U}: This creature can't be blocked this turn. Activate only if you own a card in exile."
 *
 * Covered:
 *   - Ward {2} is present as a keyword.
 *   - The activated ability is gated by [ActivationRestriction.OnlyIfCondition] on "you own a card
 *     in exile" (modeled as `Exists(Player.You, Zone.EXILE)`): it cannot be activated with an empty
 *     exile, but can once a card sits in the player's exile.
 *   - On resolution it grants CANT_BE_BLOCKED until end of turn.
