/**
 * Cemetery Prowler (VOW #191) — {1}{G}{G} Creature — Wolf, 3/4.
 *
 * "Vigilance
 *  Whenever this creature enters or attacks, exile a card from a graveyard.
 *  Spells you cast cost {1} less to cast for each card type they share with cards exiled with this
 *  creature."
 *
 * `CostReductionSource.SharedCardTypesWithLinkedExile` is the only reduction source whose amount
 * depends on the *spell being cast* rather than on the board, which is why the reduction had to be
 * threaded the caster's `CardDefinition`. The tests that matter are the two the card's own rulings
 * call out: the count is over **card types, not cards** (two exiled creature cards are still {1}),
 * and a spell sharing several types with the pile gets several reductions.
