/**
 * Jacob Hauken, Inspector // Hauken's Insight (VOW #65).
 *
 *   Front — Jacob Hauken, Inspector (0/2) — {T}: Draw a card, then exile a card from your hand
 *           face down. You may look at that card for as long as it remains exiled. You may pay
 *           {4}{U}{U}. If you do, transform Jacob Hauken.
 *   Back  — Hauken's Insight — At the beginning of your upkeep, exile the top card of your library
 *           face down. You may look at that card for as long as it remains exiled. Once during
 *           each of your turns, you may play a land or cast a spell from among the cards exiled
 *           with this permanent without paying its mana cost.
 *
 * Three propositions carry the card, and each is something the engine could not express before:
 *
 *  1. **You can see your own face-down exiled cards; your opponent cannot.** CR 708.5 gives exile
 *     no controller baseline, so the look has to be granted explicitly — and it is *only* a look:
 *     the front face grants no permission to play what it exiled.
 *  2. **The pile survives the flip**, because the link rides the permanent and transforming does
 *     not create a new object (CR 712.9).
 *  3. **"Play a land **or** cast a spell" is one allowance, not two.** Whichever the controller
 *     takes, the other is gone for the turn.
