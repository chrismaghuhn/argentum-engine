/**
 * Niko, Light of Hope — Duskmourn: House of Horror #224
 * {2}{W}{U} · Legendary Creature — Human Wizard · 3/4
 *
 * When Niko enters, create two Shard tokens. (They're enchantments with "{2}, Sacrifice this
 * token: Scry 1, then draw a card.")
 * {2}, {T}: Exile target nonlegendary creature you control. Shards you control become copies of it
 * until the next end step. Return it to the battlefield under its owner's control at the beginning
 * of the next end step.
 *
 * The Shard token is a predefined enchantment token ([Effects.CreateShard]) — the Clue token's
 * enchantment cousin (Scry 1 then draw rather than just draw).
 *
 * The activated ability composes three established pieces:
 *  1. [Patterns.Exile.exileUntilEndStep] — exile the target and schedule a delayed
 *     "return it at the beginning of the next end step" trigger (the same blink Liberate uses).
 *  2. [Effects.EachPermanentBecomesCopyOfTarget] with `sourceFromAnyZone = true` — the Shards
 *     (filtered by name) become copies of the just-exiled creature, reading its copiable values
 *     from exile (the same off-battlefield copy source Lazav, Familiar Stranger uses).
 *  3. [Duration.UntilNextEndStep] times the copies to wear off on entry to that same end step, so
 *     the source returns and the Shards revert to enchantments together (CR 707: copiable values
 *     only — the Shards keep their own counters/auras, of which they have none).
 *
 * The copy reads the exiled creature's characteristics as they last existed on the battlefield (a
 * creature already copying something is read in exile from its last on-battlefield card identity),
 * matching the printed rulings for the common case.
