/**
 * Case of the Stashed Skeleton — Murders at Karlov Manor #80
 * {1}{B} · Enchantment — Case · Rare
 *
 * When this Case enters, create a 2/1 black Skeleton creature token and suspect it.
 * To solve — You control no suspected Skeletons.
 * Solved — {1}{B}, Sacrifice this Case: Search your library for a card, put it into your hand,
 * then shuffle. Activate only as a sorcery.
 *
 * The Case builds its own obstacle: the Skeleton it makes is the suspected Skeleton that keeps it
 * unsolved, so solving it means getting rid of the Skeleton (chumping with it, sacrificing it) or
 * clearing the designation (Airtight Alibi, Absolving Lammasu). The token is addressed through the
 * `CREATED_TOKENS` pipeline slot, so the suspect lands on the token this resolution just made
 * rather than on any Skeleton.
 *
 * "You control no suspected Skeletons" is a negated existence check, which is the right shape for
 * the corner cases too: a Skeleton that stops being suspected, or a suspected creature that stops
 * being a Skeleton, both satisfy it — and so does controlling no Skeletons at all, which is why an
 * opponent's removal spell solves the Case for you.
 *
 * The Solved tutor is unrestricted ("a card") and sorcery-speed, and sacrifices the Case as part
 * of the cost, so the Case is gone before the search begins.
