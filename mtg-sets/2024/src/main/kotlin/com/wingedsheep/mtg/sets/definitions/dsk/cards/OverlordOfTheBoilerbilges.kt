/**
 * Overlord of the Boilerbilges
 * {4}{R}{R}
 * Enchantment Creature — Avatar Horror
 * 5/5
 *
 * Impending 4—{2}{R}{R} (If you cast this spell for its impending cost, it enters with four
 * time counters and isn't a creature until the last is removed. At the beginning of your
 * end step, remove a time counter from it.)
 *
 * Whenever this permanent enters or attacks, it deals 4 damage to any target.
 *
 * Impending is wired by the `impending(n, cost)` DSL helper (CR 702.176): the alternative
 * cost, the "isn't a creature while it has a time counter" type-removing static ability, and
 * the "remove a time counter at the beginning of your end step" trigger. The engine places
 * the four time counters when the spell is cast for its impending cost.
 *
 * The "enters or attacks" ability is one effect referenced by two triggered abilities (an
 * enters-the-battlefield trigger and an attacks trigger), each declaring its own "any target"
 * so the controller picks the target as each trigger resolves.
