/**
 * Homunculus Horde
 * {3}{U}
 * Creature — Homunculus
 * 2/2
 *
 * Whenever you draw your second card each turn, create a token that's a copy of this creature.
 *
 * The draw trigger uses `Triggers.<player>.drawsNth(n)` (n = 2), the shared "your Nth card each turn"
 * detector that fires exactly once per turn when your second card is drawn. The payoff is a copy
 * of this permanent via [Effects.CreateTokenCopyOfSelf]. The token copies the printed
 * characteristics (including this ability), so it can snowball if it too draws a second card.
