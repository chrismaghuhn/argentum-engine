/**
 * Dreadwing Scavenger
 * {1}{U}{B}
 * Creature — Nightmare Bird
 * 2/2
 *
 * Flying
 * Whenever this creature enters or attacks, draw a card, then discard a card.
 * Threshold — This creature gets +1/+1 and has deathtouch as long as there are seven or more
 * cards in your graveyard.
 *
 * "Enters or attacks" is modeled as the established pair of triggered abilities (one on
 * `Triggers.self.enters()`, one on `Triggers.self.attacks()`), each running the [Patterns.Hand.loot]
 * draw-then-discard. The threshold buff is two [ConditionalStaticAbility]s gated on
 * [Conditions.CardsInGraveyardAtLeast] — one stat buff, one keyword grant — so it turns on and
 * off continuously with the graveyard count.
