/**
 * Threats Around Every Corner
 * {3}{G}
 * Enchantment
 * When this enchantment enters, manifest dread.
 * Whenever a face-down permanent you control enters, search your library for a basic land card,
 * put it onto the battlefield tapped, then shuffle.
 *
 * The enters trigger reuses the shared [Patterns.Library.manifestDread] recipe. The payoff is a
 * standard ANY-binding enters trigger filtered to face-down permanents you control
 * ([GameObjectFilter.Any] + `faceDown().youControl()`) — note the manifest-dread permanent from the
 * first trigger itself counts, so it fetches a land too. The fetch is the shared
 * [Patterns.Library.searchLibrary] pipeline restricted to basic lands, entering the battlefield
 * tapped, shuffling afterward.
