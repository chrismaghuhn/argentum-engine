/**
 * Lamplight Phoenix — Murders at Karlov Manor #137
 * {1}{R}{R} · Creature — Phoenix · Rare
 * 3/3
 *
 * The dies trigger functions from the graveyard so its composite optional payment can exile the
 * Phoenix itself before collecting evidence. That ordering matters: the Phoenix is no longer in
 * the graveyard when the evidence selection is made, so it cannot help pay its own evidence cost.
 * The payment composite stops on failure, and the return happens only after both parts succeed.
