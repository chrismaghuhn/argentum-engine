/**
 * Unidentified Hovership
 * {1}{W}{W}
 * Artifact — Vehicle
 * 2/2
 * Flying
 * When this Vehicle enters, exile up to one target creature with toughness 5 or less.
 * When this Vehicle leaves the battlefield, the exiled card's owner manifests dread.
 * Crew 1
 *
 * The ETB exiles the target via [Effects.ExileUntilLeaves], which links it to this source's
 * [com.wingedsheep.engine.state.components.battlefield.LinkedExileComponent]. Unlike a typical
 * "exile until ~ leaves" card, the exiled card is *not* returned — it stays exiled. The link
 * exists only so the leaves-the-battlefield trigger can find the exiled card's owner.
 *
 * On leave, [Player.OwnersOfLinkedExile] resolves to the distinct owners of the still-exiled
 * linked cards (CR ruling: "each player who owns one or more of the exiled cards manifests
 * dread" — once per owner, nothing when the pile is empty), and each manifests dread (CR 701.62)
 * via [Effects.ForEachPlayer] rebinding the shared [Patterns.Library.manifestDread] recipe to
 * that player (same construction as Fear of Impostors).
