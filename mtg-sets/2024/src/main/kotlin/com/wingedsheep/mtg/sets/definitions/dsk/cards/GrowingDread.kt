/**
 * Growing Dread
 * {G}{U}
 * Enchantment
 * Flash
 * When this enchantment enters, manifest dread. (Look at the top two cards of your library. Put
 * one onto the battlefield face down as a 2/2 creature and the other into your graveyard. Turn it
 * face up any time for its mana cost if it's a creature card.)
 * Whenever you turn a permanent face up, put a +1/+1 counter on it.
 *
 * The enters trigger reuses the shared [Patterns.Library.manifestDread] recipe. The face-up
 * payoff is the standard `Triggers.<player>.permanentTurnedFaceUp(filter)` (any face-up turn you control — in DSK
 * every face-up permanent is a manifested creature) putting a +1/+1 counter on the triggering
 * permanent via [EffectTarget.TriggeringEntity].
