/**
 * Connecting the Dots — Murders at Karlov Manor #118
 * {1}{R} · Enchantment
 *
 * Whenever a creature you control attacks, exile the top card of your library face down.
 * {1}{R}, Discard your hand, Sacrifice this enchantment: Put all cards exiled with this
 * enchantment into their owners' hands.
 *
 * The two halves are one mechanism: the exile side stamps `linkToSource`, and the payoff reads that
 * same linked pile back with [Effects.ReturnLinkedExileToHand]. That link is what makes the first
 * ruling true without any extra wiring — each copy of this enchantment owns its own pile, so a
 * second Connecting the Dots can't cash in the first one's cards. It's also why the second ruling
 * holds: sacrificing or bouncing the enchantment destroys the link, and the cards stay in exile
 * face down forever.
 *
 * `FaceDownMode.HIDDEN` is the "face down in exile" mode (the hideaway shape), so the cards are
 * genuinely unlookable rather than merely unrevealed — the parenthetical "(You can't look at it.)"
 * is load-bearing, and hidden exile is what masks them from their own controller.
 *
 * The trigger is per-attacker (`binding = ANY` over creatures you control), not a
 * once-per-declaration `YouAttack`: attacking with three creatures exiles three cards.
 *
 * Discarding your hand is [Costs.DiscardHand], which is payable with an empty hand — the third
 * ruling — because it discards whatever is there rather than requiring a card.
