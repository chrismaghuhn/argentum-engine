/**
 * Saw
 * {2}
 * Artifact — Equipment
 * Equipped creature gets +2/+0.
 * Whenever equipped creature attacks, you may sacrifice a permanent other than that creature or
 * this Equipment. If you do, draw a card.
 * Equip {2}
 *
 * The static buff is the usual [ModifyStats] over [Filters.EquippedCreature]. The attack trigger
 * binds to the attached creature ([TriggerBinding.ATTACHED] on `Triggers.<subject>.attacks(requires)`, i.e. "whenever
 * equipped creature attacks"). The "you may sacrifice … If you do, draw" pay-then-payoff is a
 * [GatedEffect] with a [Gate.MayPay] whose cost is a [SacrificeEffect] over permanents you control;
 * `excludeSource = true` removes this Equipment from the choices and `notAttachedToBySource()`
 * removes the equipped creature ("that creature"), so the sacrifice is "a permanent other than that
 * creature or this Equipment". Declining (or controlling no other sacrificeable permanent) skips
 * the draw.
