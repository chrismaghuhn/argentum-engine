/**
 * Glassworks // Shattered Yard (DSK 137) — split-layout Room (CR 709.5).
 *
 * Glassworks {2}{R} — Enchantment — Room
 *   When you unlock this door, this Room deals 4 damage to target creature an opponent controls.
 *
 * Shattered Yard {4}{R} — Enchantment — Room
 *   At the beginning of your end step, this Room deals 1 damage to each opponent.
 *
 * Cast each half separately; the cast face enters unlocked, the other locked. Pay the locked
 * face's printed mana cost as a sorcery-speed special action to unlock it (CR 709.5e). Both
 * doors use the Room itself as the damage source (the default when no explicit `damageSource`
 * is given to [Effects.DealDamage]).
