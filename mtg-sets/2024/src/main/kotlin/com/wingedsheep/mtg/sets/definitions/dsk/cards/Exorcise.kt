/**
 * Exorcise
 * {1}{W}
 * Sorcery
 *
 * Exile target artifact, enchantment, or creature with power 4 or greater.
 *
 * The "power 4 or greater" clause binds only to the creature branch (it's "artifact,
 * enchantment, or [creature with power 4+]"), so an artifact or enchantment with any
 * power is a legal target — modelled as a three-way OR where only the creature branch
 * carries the [powerAtLeast] predicate.
