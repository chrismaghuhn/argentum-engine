/**
 * Valgavoth, Terror Eater
 * {6}{B}{B}{B}
 * Legendary Creature — Elder Demon
 * 9/9
 *
 * Flying, lifelink
 * Ward—Sacrifice three nonland permanents.
 * If a card you didn't control would be put into an opponent's graveyard from anywhere,
 * exile it instead.
 * During your turn, you may play cards exiled with Valgavoth. If you cast a spell this way,
 * pay life equal to its mana value rather than pay its mana cost.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *  - The graveyard-replacement is the reusable [RedirectZoneChange] with `linkToSource = true`,
 *    so every card it exiles is tethered to Valgavoth's `LinkedExileComponent`. The filter scopes
 *    it to nontoken cards whose owner is an opponent ("an opponent's graveyard") that the source's
 *    controller doesn't control ("a card you didn't control") — a stolen opponent's permanent that
 *    dies under your control is therefore not exiled (CR-faithful via `Not(ControlledByYou)`).
 *  - The play permission is [GrantMayCastFromLinkedExile]: it waives the mana cost
 *    (`withoutPayingManaCost`) and substitutes the alternative life cost
 *    `PayLifeEqualToManaValueOfSpell`, so casting a spell this way pays life equal to its mana
 *    value rather than its mana cost. Lands exiled with Valgavoth are played for free (no spell,
 *    no life). The grant is timed to your turn (`duringYourTurnOnly`).
