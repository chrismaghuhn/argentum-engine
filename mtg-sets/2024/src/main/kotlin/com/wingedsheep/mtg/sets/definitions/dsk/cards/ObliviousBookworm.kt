/**
 * Oblivious Bookworm
 * {G}{U}
 * Creature — Human Wizard
 * 2/3
 * At the beginning of your end step, you may draw a card. If you do, discard a card unless a
 *   permanent entered the battlefield face down under your control this turn or you turned a
 *   permanent face up this turn.
 *
 * Modeled as: end-step trigger → Effects.May (the optional draw) → IfYouDo (gate the rider on the
 * draw actually happening) → a discard that is itself gated to run only when neither face-down
 * condition holds ("...unless..."). Per the Scryfall ruling, the unless-check is evaluated as the
 * ability resolves, so the per-turn trackers reflect everything that happened earlier this turn.
