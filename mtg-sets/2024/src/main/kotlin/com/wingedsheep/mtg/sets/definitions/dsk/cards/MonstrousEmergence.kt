/**
 * Monstrous Emergence
 * {1}{G}
 * Sorcery
 * As an additional cost to cast this spell, choose a creature you control or reveal a creature
 * card from your hand.
 * Monstrous Emergence deals damage equal to the power of the creature you chose or the card you
 * revealed to target creature.
 *
 * Modeled like Close Encounter: an `AdditionalCost.ChooseEntity` over the caster's battlefield
 * creatures and hand creature cards, capturing a power snapshot (LKI) so the damage still resolves
 * if the chosen battlefield creature later leaves play. The damage reads the chosen entity's power
 * via `EffectTarget.PipelineTarget`.
 *
 * "You control" / "from your hand" are implicit — per-zone iteration already restricts to the
 * caster's battlefield slice and the caster's hand.
