/**
 * Reenact the Crime — Murders at Karlov Manor #70
 * {1}{U}{U}{U} · Instant
 *
 * Exile target nonland card in a graveyard that was put there from anywhere this turn. Copy it.
 * You may cast the copy without paying its mana cost.
 *
 * The graveyard-history predicate deliberately accepts a card put there from any zone, not merely
 * one that died. The resolution then uses the shared exile → copy → optional free-cast pipeline.
 * The cast happens during this spell's resolution; declining leaves a phantom copy that the
 * state-based-action check removes.
