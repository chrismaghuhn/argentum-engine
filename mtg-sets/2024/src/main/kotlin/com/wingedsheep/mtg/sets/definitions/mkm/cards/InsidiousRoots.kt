/**
 * Insidious Roots — Murders at Karlov Manor #208
 * {B}{G} · Enchantment · Uncommon
 *
 * Creature tokens you control have "{T}: Add one mana of any color."
 * Whenever one or more creature cards leave your graveyard, create a 0/1 green Plant creature
 * token, then put a +1/+1 counter on each Plant you control.
 *
 * Two mana for an engine that turns graveyard recursion into a widening board *and* a mana base:
 * every Plant it makes is a Cryptolith Rite land, and every subsequent trigger grows all of them at
 * once. Note the counters go on **Plants**, not on all creature tokens — the Plant tokens it made
 * itself are the ones that compound.
 *
 * The first ability is [CryptolithRite]'s [GrantActivatedAbility] narrowed to `token()`; the
 * granted ability is `isManaAbility = true` with `TimingRule.ManaAbility` so the raw
 * [ActivatedAbility] constructor carries the classification the card-DSL builder's `manaAbility`
 * flag would set. The printed ruling about Insidious Roots granting *itself* the ability when it is
 * somehow a creature token falls out of the filter — it says "creature tokens you control", not
 * "other", so nothing excludes the source.
 *
 * The trigger is `Triggers.oneOrMore(filter).leaveYourGraveyard()`, the CR 603.2c batch shape [ChalkOutline] uses:
 * a mass reanimation, a flashback cast and a graveyard-exiling sweep each fire it exactly once no
 * matter how many creature cards moved or where they went — which is what the second printed ruling
 * says in as many words. The filter matches the *card*, so a creature card cast from the graveyard
 * counts on its way to the stack.
 *
 * The payoff is ordered, not simultaneous: the token is created first and then the counters land, so
 * the new Plant gets a counter too and enters play as a 1/2. [Effects.ForEachInGroup] snapshots the
 * group before iterating, and the snapshot is taken after the token exists.
 *
 * The Plant token takes its art from MKM's `tokenArt` layer, so no `imageUri` is baked in here.
