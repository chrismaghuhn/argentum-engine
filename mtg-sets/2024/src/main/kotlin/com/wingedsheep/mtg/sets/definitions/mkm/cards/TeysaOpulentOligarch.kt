/**
 * Teysa, Opulent Oligarch — Murders at Karlov Manor #234
 * {1}{W}{B} · Legendary Creature — Human Advisor · 2/3
 *
 * The end-step count is evaluated on resolution, so every opponent who lost life this turn
 * contributes one investigation even if that opponent subsequently left the game. The Clue trigger
 * observes every battlefield-to-graveyard move rather than only sacrifices, and its once-per-turn
 * cap is spent when the first qualifying event triggers.
