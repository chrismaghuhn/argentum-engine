/**
 * Overlord of the Mistmoors
 * {5}{W}{W}
 * Enchantment Creature — Avatar Horror
 * 6/6
 *
 * Impending 4—{2}{W}{W} (If you cast this spell for its impending cost, it enters with four
 * time counters and isn't a creature until the last is removed. At the beginning of your
 * end step, remove a time counter from it.)
 *
 * Whenever this permanent enters or attacks, create two 2/1 white Insect creature tokens with
 * flying.
 *
 * Impending is wired by the `impending(n, cost)` DSL helper (CR 702.176): the alternative cost,
 * the "isn't a creature while it has a time counter" type-removing static ability, and the
 * "remove a time counter at the beginning of your end step" trigger. The engine places the four
 * time counters when the spell is cast for its impending cost.
 *
 * The "enters or attacks" ability is one effect referenced by both the enters and attacks
 * triggers (sibling pattern to Overlord of the Hauntwoods). The created tokens are 2/1 white
 * flying Insects (DSK white Insect token).
