/**
 * Painter's Studio // Defaced Gallery (DSK 147) — split-layout Room (CR 709.5).
 *
 * Painter's Studio {2}{R} — Enchantment — Room
 *   When you unlock this door, exile the top two cards of your library. You may play them until
 *   the end of your next turn.
 *
 * Defaced Gallery {1}{R} — Enchantment — Room
 *   Whenever you attack, attacking creatures you control get +1/+0 until end of turn.
 *
 * Cast each half separately; the cast face enters unlocked, the other locked. Pay the locked
 * face's printed mana cost as a sorcery-speed special action to unlock it (CR 709.5e). The
 * Painter's Studio door-unlock impulse uses [MayPlayExpiry.UntilEndOfNextTurn] for the
 * "until the end of your next turn" play window.
