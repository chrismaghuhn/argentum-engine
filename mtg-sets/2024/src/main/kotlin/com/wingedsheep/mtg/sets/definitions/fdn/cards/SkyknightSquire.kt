/**
 * Skyknight Squire
 * {1}{W}
 * Creature — Cat Scout
 * 1/1
 *
 * Whenever another creature you control enters, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature.
 * As long as this creature has three or more +1/+1 counters on it, it has flying and is
 * a Knight in addition to its other types.
 *
 * The grow trigger uses `Triggers.another(GameObjectFilter.Creature.youControl()).enters()` (OTHER binding, Creature.youControl()
 * filter). The threshold buff is modeled as two conditional [staticAbility] blocks gated on
 * [Conditions.SourceCounterCountAtLeast] — one granting FLYING, one granting the Knight
 * subtype ([GrantSubtype] is additive, "in addition to its other types"). Both apply only
 * while the source carries 3+ +1/+1 counters, projected through the layer system.
