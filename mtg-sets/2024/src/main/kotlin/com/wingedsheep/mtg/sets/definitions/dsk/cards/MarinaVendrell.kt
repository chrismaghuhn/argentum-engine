/**
 * Marina Vendrell — Duskmourn: House of Horror #221
 * {W}{U}{B}{R}{G} · Legendary Creature — Human Warlock · 3/5
 *
 * When Marina Vendrell enters, reveal the top seven cards of your library. Put all enchantment
 * cards from among them into your hand and the rest on the bottom of your library in a random order.
 * {T}: Lock or unlock a door of target Room you control. Activate only as a sorcery.
 *
 * The ETB is the new [Patterns.Library.revealTopPutAllMatchingToHand] recipe — a mandatory reveal of
 * the top seven that auto-routes *every* enchantment to hand (a choice-free filter partition, not a
 * "keep up to one" choice) and drops the rest to the bottom in a random order.
 *
 * The activated ability is the established "lock or unlock a door" choice
 * ([Effects.LockOrUnlockDoor], a modal of lock/unlock that prompts which door when the Room has more
 * than one eligible) over a sorcery-speed `{T}` — the same shape as Keys to the House's second
 * ability, minus the mana/sacrifice cost. "Target Room you control" carries no door restriction:
 * any Room you control always has at least one door of one kind, so either choice can do something.
