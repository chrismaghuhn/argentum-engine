/**

 * The optional discard is the action of a reflexive trigger, so the damage ability is created only
 * after two cards were actually discarded. The discarded pipeline collection crosses onto that
 * reflexive ability; filtering it to the greatest mana value (keeping ties) lets the ordinary
 * stored-card mana-value amount drive the damage to every creature.
