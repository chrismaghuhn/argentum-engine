/**
 * Hedge Shredder
 * {2}{G}{G}
 * Artifact — Vehicle
 * 5/5
 * Whenever this Vehicle attacks, you may mill two cards.
 * Whenever one or more land cards are put into your graveyard from your library, put them onto
 * the battlefield tapped.
 * Crew 1
 *
 * The second ability is a library-to-graveyard batching trigger ("one or more ... are put into
 * your graveyard" fires once per event regardless of how many cards moved, per CR 603.2c on a
 * single trigger event): the milled land cards that caused it are captured into the resolving
 * ability's pipeline under
 * [IterationSpace.TRIGGER_CAPTURED_COLLECTION], and a [MoveCollectionEffect] moves
 * exactly those cards from the graveyard onto the battlefield tapped under the controller's
 * control. Because the trigger feeds off the same mill the first ability performs, milling lands
 * (e.g. from "may mill two cards") puts them straight into play.
