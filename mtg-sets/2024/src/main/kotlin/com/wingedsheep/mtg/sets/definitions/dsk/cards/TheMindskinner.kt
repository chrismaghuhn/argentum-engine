 * 10/1
 *
 * The Mindskinner can't be blocked.
 * If a source you control would deal damage to an opponent, prevent that damage and each opponent
 * mills that many cards.
 *
 * The second ability is a damage replacement ([ReplaceDamageWithMill]): it covers both combat
 * damage from the unblockable 10/1 and noncombat damage from any other source you control. The
 * damage is replaced (CR 615) — neither dealt nor "prevented" in the shield sense — and each
 * opponent mills that many cards instead.
