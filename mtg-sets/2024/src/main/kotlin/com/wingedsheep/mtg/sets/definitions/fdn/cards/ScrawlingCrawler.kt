/**
 * Scrawling Crawler
 * {3}
 * Artifact Creature — Phyrexian Construct
 * 3/2
 *
 * At the beginning of your upkeep, each player draws a card.
 * Whenever an opponent draws a card, that player loses 1 life.
 *
 * The symmetric group-draw uses `DrawCards(Player.Each)`; the punisher clause fires per card an
 * opponent draws (`Triggers.anOpponent.draws()`, CR 121.2), draining the player who drew via
 * `Player.TriggeringPlayer`. Cards an opponent draws from the upkeep clause therefore also drain
 * them — the two abilities compose without special-casing.
