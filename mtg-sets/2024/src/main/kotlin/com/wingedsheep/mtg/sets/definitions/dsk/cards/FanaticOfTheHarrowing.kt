/**
 * Fanatic of the Harrowing
 * {3}{B}
 * Creature — Human Cleric
 * 2/2
 *
 * When this creature enters, each player discards a card. If you discarded a card this way, draw a card.
 *
 * Modeled as an enters trigger. Each player discards one card: opponents via
 * [Patterns.Hand.eachOpponentDiscards], and the controller's discard is wrapped in an
 * [Effects.IfYouDo] so the follow-up draw only happens when the controller actually had a card to
 * discard (CR — "If you discarded a card this way"). [SuccessCriterion.Auto] infers the gate from
 * the discard pipeline's terminal move to the graveyard, so an empty-handed controller draws
 * nothing. A player with an empty hand simply doesn't discard.
