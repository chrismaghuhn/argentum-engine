/**
 * Zul Ashur, Lich Lord
 * {1}{B}
 * Legendary Creature — Zombie Warlock
 * 2/2
 *
 * Ward—Pay 2 life.
 * {T}: You may cast target Zombie creature card from your graveyard this turn.
 *
 * Implementation:
 * - Ward is the printed [WardCost.Life] (counter unless the targeting opponent pays 2 life).
 * - The activated ability gathers the chosen Zombie-creature card ([CardSource.ChosenTargets]) and
 *   grants a may-play-from-graveyard permission ([GrantMayPlayFromExileEffect]) that expires at end
 *   of turn. The card is not moved out of the graveyard — the cast enumerator already honours a
 *   `MayPlayPermission` on a graveyard card (Tinybones, the Pickpocket). No `withAnyManaType` and no
 *   flash grant, so the card is cast for its normal cost following normal timing rules, matching the
 *   Scryfall ruling ("You pay all costs and follow all normal timing rules for Zombie creature cards
 *   cast with the permission"). The "may" is the permission itself — the player chooses whether to cast.
