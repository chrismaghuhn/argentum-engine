/**
 * Memory Vessel
 * {3}{R}{R}
 * Artifact
 * {T}, Exile this artifact: Each player exiles the top seven cards of their library. Until your
 * next turn, players may play cards they exiled this way, and they can't play cards from their
 * hand. Activate only as a sorcery.
 *
 * Per-player impulse: for each player (APNAP order, CR 101.4) gather the top seven of *their*
 * library and exile them, then grant that player permission to play those exiled cards and bar
 * them from playing cards from their hand. Both windows last "until your next turn" — the
 * *activating* player's next turn, the same for everyone. `ForEachPlayer` rebinds the body's
 * controller to each player so `Player.You` and `EffectTarget.Controller` resolve to them, while
 * the grant/restriction executors key the turn-boundary expiry off the source's controller (the
 * activating player) so an opponent's window doesn't lift at the start of their own turn.
 *
 * "Until your next turn" (not "until the end of your next turn") → the may-play window uses the
 * "next upkeep, not this turn's" expiry shape; the can't-play-from-hand restriction uses the
 * matching `Duration.UntilYourNextTurn`, both cleared on the activating player's next untap.
