/**
 * Expose the Culprit — Murders at Karlov Manor #124
 * {1}{R} · Instant · Uncommon
 *
 * Choose one or both —
 * • Turn target face-down creature face up.
 * • Exile any number of face-up creatures you control with disguise in a face-down pile, shuffle
 *   that pile, then cloak them.
 *
 * **"Choose one or both" is the count, not a third mode** — `chooseCount = 2` with
 * `minChooseCount = 1` (CR 700.2), the same shape as Winterflame. Spelling "both" as an extra mode
 * would misreport `SpellCastEvent.chosenModesCount` and give a mode-changing copy effect three
 * modes to pick from instead of two.
 *
 * **Mode 1** is Break Open without the "an opponent controls" clause: any face-down creature is a
 * legal target, including your own. Turning it face up is *not* the special action — no cost is
 * paid and no reveal-a-creature-card requirement applies (CR 701.58c is about the special action,
 * not about effects that turn a permanent face up). The printed ruling for a face-down *instant or
 * sorcery* card is that it is revealed and stays face down, with no turned-face-up trigger;
 * `TurnFaceUpExecutor` already owns that branch, which is why this mode is one effect and not a
 * conditional.
 *
 * **Mode 2 is not a targeted mode.** "Exile any number of face-up creatures you control" prints no
 * "target", so it is a resolution-time choice — a gather → choose → exile → return pipeline, not a
 * `TargetPermanent(unlimited = true)`. That distinction is load-bearing: shroud, protection and
 * "can't be the target of spells" on your own creature do not stop this, and a creature that
 * becomes an illegal target between cast and resolution is still eligible.
 *
 * The `withDisguise()` filter is the **printed** disguise ability (CR 702.168), read off the card
 * in any zone — deliberately not `withMorph()`, which asks the "can this be turned face up"
 * question and would also answer true for a cloaked or manifested permanent. Combined with
 * `faceUp()` it is exactly the card's wording: a disguise creature you already turned face up (or
 * simply hard-cast) can be hidden away again, which is the card's whole trick.
 *
 * **The shuffle is informational.** In paper the pile is shuffled so opponents can't track which
 * cloaked permanent is which (the printed ruling adds "after you cloak the creatures, you may look
 * at them" — the controller keeps the information). This engine hides a face-down permanent's card
 * from everyone but its controller regardless of order, so the shuffle changes no game state; it is
 * expressed as `CardOrder.Random` on the return move so the intent survives in the script rather
 * than being silently dropped.
 *
 * Cloaking is `FaceDownMode.CLOAK` on the move that puts the cards onto the battlefield (CR 701.58)
 * — the 2/2 body and the ward {2} are data on the mode, not abilities this card grants. The cards
 * genuinely pass through exile, so each returns as a **new object**: Auras fall off, counters are
 * gone, and summoning sickness applies afresh.
