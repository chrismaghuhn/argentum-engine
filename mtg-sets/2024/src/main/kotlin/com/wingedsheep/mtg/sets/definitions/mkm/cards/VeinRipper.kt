/**
 * Vein Ripper — Murders at Karlov Manor #110
 * {3}{B}{B}{B} · Creature — Vampire Assassin · 6/5
 *
 * Flying
 * Ward—Sacrifice a creature.
 * Whenever a creature dies, target opponent loses 2 life and you gain 2 life.
 *
 * The drain trigger is `Triggers.a(GameObjectFilter.Creature).dies()` — *any* creature, either side of the table,
 * including the Ripper itself. That last case matters and falls out for free: the Ripper dying is a
 * creature dying, so it drains once on the way out (the trigger is detected from the zone-change
 * event, which is emitted whether or not the source survives to see it).
 *
 * "Target opponent" is chosen when the trigger goes on the stack, so a board wipe puts one trigger
 * per dead creature on the stack and each picks its own target. [Effects.DrainLife] is the single
 * "N from them, N to you" primitive — modelling it as separate lose/gain effects would let the gain
 * happen even when the loss was prevented or the opponent left the game.
 *
 * Ward—Sacrifice a creature ([WardCost.Sacrifice]) is the real protection: it isn't a mana tax an
 * opponent can simply pay through, it's a second creature, which usually means removal on the Ripper
 * costs them their own board. Ward triggers on becoming a target of an opponent's spell or ability
 * (CR 702.21b), so it does nothing against edicts or board wipes that never target.
