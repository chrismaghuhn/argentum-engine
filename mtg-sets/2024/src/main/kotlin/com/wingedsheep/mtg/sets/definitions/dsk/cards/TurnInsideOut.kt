/**
 * Turn Inside Out
 * {R}
 * Instant
 * Target creature gets +3/+0 until end of turn. When it dies this turn, manifest dread. (Look at
 * the top two cards of your library. Put one onto the battlefield face down as a 2/2 creature and
 * the other into your graveyard. Turn it face up any time for its mana cost if it's a creature
 * card.)
 *
 * Modeled like Desperate Measures: a +3/+0 stat change until end of turn plus a watched-entity
 * delayed `Triggers.self.dies()` trigger scoped to the buffed creature via `watchedTarget`, expiring at
 * end of turn. When the creature dies this turn, the delayed trigger runs the shared
 * [Patterns.Library.manifestDread] recipe for the spell's controller. The trigger is scoped by
 * entity id, so it fires regardless of who controlled the creature when it died — matching the
 * printed "When it dies this turn" (no controller restriction).
