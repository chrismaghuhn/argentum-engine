/**
 * Steer Clear
 * {W}
 * Instant
 *
 * Steer Clear deals 2 damage to target attacking or blocking creature. Steer Clear deals 4 damage
 * to that creature instead if you controlled a Mount as you cast this spell.
 *
 * "As you cast this spell" is a cast-time condition capture (CR 601.2i): whether you controlled a
 * Mount is locked in the moment the spell is cast and read back at resolution, so losing the Mount
 * before resolution doesn't drop the damage to 2 (per the OTJ ruling). Modeled with the
 * `captureAtCast` DSL + `Conditions.CapturedAtCast`; the [Effects.If] picks the 4- or 2-damage
 * branch against the frozen answer.
