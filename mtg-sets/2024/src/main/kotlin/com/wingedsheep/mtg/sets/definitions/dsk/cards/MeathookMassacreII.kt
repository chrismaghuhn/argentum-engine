/**
 * Meathook Massacre II
 * {X}{X}{B}{B}{B}{B}
 * Legendary Enchantment
 *
 * When Meathook Massacre II enters, each player sacrifices X creatures of their choice.
 * Whenever a creature you control dies, you may pay 3 life. If you do, return that card
 * under your control with a finality counter on it.
 * Whenever a creature an opponent controls dies, they may pay 3 life. If they don't,
 * return that card under your control with a finality counter on it.
 *
 * The three abilities all key off the dying creature (`EffectTarget.TriggeringEntity`) and reanimate
 * it under *your* control (the ability's controller) with a finality counter — the established
 * "return … with a finality counter" composition (Rite of the Moth, Zoraline): `Move(GRAVEYARD →
 * BATTLEFIELD)` + `AddCounters(FINALITY)`.
 *
 *  - **ETB** — [DynamicAmount.CastX] reads the `{X}{X}` value off the cast enchantment and rides it
 *    onto the permanent, so `Effects.Sacrifice(Creature, count = CastX, target = Each)` makes each
 *    player choose X of their creatures to sacrifice (APNAP order, CR 101.4).
 *
 *  - **Your creature dies** — opt-in [Effects.MayPay] (Gate.MayPay): *you* may pay 3 life, and
 *    only then is the card returned. Cost and decision default to the ability's controller (you).
 *
 *  - **An opponent's creature dies** — pay-to-prevent, the inverse reading, via [PayOrSufferEffect]
 *    with `player = Player.TriggeringPlayer`: the *dying creature's last-known controller* (the
 *    opponent) decides and pays. If they decline, the suffer effect — returning the card under your
 *    control — resolves as part of *your* ability, so it runs under the ability's controller (you
 *    steal it). Routing the pay/suffer decision and the life payment to a non-controller, and running
 *    the consequence under the ability's controller, is the engine work this card needed (DSK engine
 *    gap #16): `Player.TriggeringPlayer` now resolves to a dying creature's last-known controller
 *    (TriggerContext populates `triggeringPlayerId` from `ZoneChangeEvent.lastKnownController`), and
 *    the PayOrSuffer consequence runs under the ability controller, not the payer.
 *
 * Per the printed rulings, tokens (no card to return) and creatures that have already left the
 * graveyard simply don't come back — both fall out naturally because `EffectTarget.TriggeringEntity`
 * finds nothing to move.
