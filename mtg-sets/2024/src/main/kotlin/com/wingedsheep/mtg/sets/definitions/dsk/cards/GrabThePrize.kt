/**
 * Grab the Prize
 * {1}{R}
 * Sorcery
 * As an additional cost to cast this spell, discard a card.
 * Draw two cards. If the discarded card wasn't a land card, Grab the Prize deals 2 damage to
 * each opponent.
 *
 * The discard is a mandatory additional cost (`Costs.additional.DiscardCards()`), so exactly one
 * card always reaches the graveyard before resolution. At resolution the conditional damage gates
 * on whether that discarded card was a land — `Conditions.DiscardedCardMatches(Land)` reads the
 * card's (now-graveyard) characteristics (CR 608.2), and `Not(...)` expresses "wasn't a land card".
