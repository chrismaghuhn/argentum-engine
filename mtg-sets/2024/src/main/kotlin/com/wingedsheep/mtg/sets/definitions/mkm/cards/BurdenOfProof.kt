 * Burden of Proof — Murders at Karlov Manor #42

 *
 * Flash
 * Enchant creature
 * Enchanted creature gets +2/+2 as long as it's a Detective you control. Otherwise, it has base
 * power and toughness 1/1 and can't block Detectives.
 *
 * One condition drives all three statics, so it is written once and negated for the "otherwise"
 * branch: [Conditions.EnchantedPermanentMatches] over a Detective-you-control filter. Both branches
 * stay live continuously — the Aura can move, the enchanted creature can gain or lose the Detective
 * type, and control can change; each recheck flips which branch projects.
 *
 * The two stat lines sit in different layers and never fight: `+2/+2` is [ModifyStats] (Layer 7c)
 * and `base power and toughness 1/1` is [SetBasePowerToughnessStatic] (Layer 7b). Because the
 * conditions are exact complements, only one is ever contributing.
 *
 * "Can't block Detectives" is expressed as its complement, [CanOnlyBlockCreaturesWith] over
 * non-Detective creatures. The two are the same restriction — every creature is either a Detective
 * or not — and this shape scopes the restriction to the enchanted creature itself, where the oracle
 * text puts it, rather than making it a property of every Detective on the battlefield. Per the
 * ruling, this is checked when blockers are declared: attaching the Aura to a creature that has
 * *already* blocked a Detective doesn't undo the block.
