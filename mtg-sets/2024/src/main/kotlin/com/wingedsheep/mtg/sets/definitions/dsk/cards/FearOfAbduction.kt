/**
 * Fear of Abduction

 * 5/5
 * As an additional cost to cast this spell, exile a creature you control.
 * Flying
 * When this creature enters, exile target creature an opponent controls.
 * When this creature leaves the battlefield, put each card exiled with it into its owner's hand.
 *
 * The ETB exile is linked to the source (CR 603.6e-style "until ~ leaves" exile pile), so the
 * leaves trigger returns exactly the card this creature exiled — to its owner's HAND, not the
 * battlefield. The additional-cost exile of your own creature is a permanent exile (not linked),
 * so it is never returned.
