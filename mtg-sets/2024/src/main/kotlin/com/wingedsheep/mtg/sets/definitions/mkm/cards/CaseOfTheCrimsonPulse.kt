/**
 * Case of the Crimson Pulse — Murders at Karlov Manor #114
 * {2}{R} · Enchantment — Case · Rare
 *
 * When this Case enters, discard a card, then draw two cards.
 * To solve — You have no cards in hand.
 * Solved — At the beginning of your upkeep, discard your hand, then draw two cards.
 *
 * Both halves are "discard, *then* draw", in that order, and both are unconditional on the discard
 * finding anything: with an empty hand you discard nothing and still draw two. That falls out of
 * composing the two effects rather than gating the draw on the discard — the printed ruling says
 * exactly this for both abilities.
 *
 * "You have no cards in hand" is a hand-size check, not a discard tracker, so anything that empties
 * your hand solves it; the enters trigger's own draw-two usually means it takes a turn cycle.
