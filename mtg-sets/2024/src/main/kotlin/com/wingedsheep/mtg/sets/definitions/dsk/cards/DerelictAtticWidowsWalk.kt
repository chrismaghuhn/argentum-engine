/**
 * Derelict Attic // Widow's Walk (DSK 93) — split-layout Room (CR 709.5).
 *
 * Derelict Attic {2}{B} — Enchantment — Room
 *   When you unlock this door, you draw two cards and you lose 2 life.
 *
 * Widow's Walk {3}{B} — Enchantment — Room
 *   Whenever a creature you control attacks alone, it gets +1/+0 and gains deathtouch
 *   until end of turn.
 *
 * Cast each half separately; the cast face enters unlocked, the other locked. Pay the locked
 * face's printed mana cost as a sorcery-speed special action to unlock it (CR 709.5e).
 *
 * Derelict Attic is a "when you unlock this door" trigger (CR 709.5h) — draw two, lose 2 life,
 * both affecting the controller. Widow's Walk reuses the attacks-alone primitive
 * `Triggers.<subject>.attacks(requires)` with `AttackPredicate.Alone` and an ANY binding over creatures you control,
 * buffing the lone attacker ("it" = [EffectTarget.TriggeringEntity]) with +1/+0 and deathtouch
 * until end of turn.
