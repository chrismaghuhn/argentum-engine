/**
 * Karlov Watchdog — Murders at Karlov Manor #20
 * {3}{W} · Creature — Dog · 3/2
 *
 * Vigilance
 * Permanents your opponents control can't be turned face up during your turn.
 * Whenever you attack with three or more creatures, creatures you control get +1/+1 until end of turn.
 *
 * The lock is white's answer to the disguise/cloak deck: on your turn an opponent can't flip a
 * face-down permanent up, so they can't ambush your attack with a surprise 4/5 in the declare-blockers
 * step. It's [CantBeTurnedFaceUp] over every permanent they control, wrapped in a
 * [ConditionalStaticAbility] gated by [Conditions.IsYourTurn] — the static is only *live* during your
 * turn, and the turn-face-up special action reads the projected flag and is rejected. "Your" resolves
 * to the Watchdog's projected controller, so a stolen Watchdog locks down its new controller's
 * opponents instead.
 *
 * `CantBeTurnedFaceUp` defaults its filter to the *attached* creature (it's normally an Aura's
 * ability, as on Unable to Scream), so the opponent-wide filter is passed explicitly.
 *
 * The attack payoff is `YouAttackEvent(minAttackers = 3)` bound ANY — the Meddling Youths shape. The
 * Watchdog need not be among the three attackers (it has vigilance, so it often attacks anyway), and
 * the trigger fires once per declare-attackers rather than once per attacker. The pump is a plain
 * Layer 7c modification over every creature you control, including creatures that didn't attack and
 * any that entered after attackers were declared but before the trigger resolved.
