/**
 * Sphinx of Forgotten Lore
 * {2}{U}{U}
 * Creature — Sphinx
 * 3/3
 *
 * Flash
 * Flying
 * Whenever this creature attacks, target instant or sorcery card in your graveyard gains
 * flashback until end of turn. The flashback cost is equal to that card's mana cost.
 *
 * The attack trigger grants Flashback (CR 702.34) at runtime via [Effects.GrantFlashback], whose
 * cost defaults to the targeted card's own mana cost (the "flashback cost is equal to that card's
 * mana cost" clause). The cast-from-graveyard enumerator, cast handler, and stack resolver honor
 * the granted flashback exactly like a printed one through the shared `FlashbackGrants` resolver;
 * the grant expires during the cleanup step. Same pattern as Archmage's Newt, keyed off the
 * attack event rather than combat damage.
