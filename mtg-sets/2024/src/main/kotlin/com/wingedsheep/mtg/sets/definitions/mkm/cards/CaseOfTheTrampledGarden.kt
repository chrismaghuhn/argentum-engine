/**
 * Case of the Trampled Garden — Murders at Karlov Manor #156
 * {2}{G} · Enchantment — Case · Uncommon
 *
 * When this Case enters, distribute two +1/+1 counters among one or two target creatures you
 * control.
 * To solve — Creatures you control have total power 8 or greater.
 * Solved — Whenever you attack, put a +1/+1 counter on target attacking creature. It gains
 * trample until end of turn.
 *
 * "Among one or two target creatures" is a target *range* — `count = 2, minCount = 1` — with the
 * distribution itself chosen as the spell is put on the stack (CR 601.2d), which is what
 * `DistributeCountersAmongTargets` models; each chosen target must get at least one counter, so
 * choosing two means one each.
 *
 * The "to solve" clause is *total* power, not a creature count, so it is a `SUM` aggregation over
 * power rather than a `COUNT` — one 8/8 solves it as readily as eight 1/1s. It reads projected
 * power, so an anthem or the Case's own counters count toward it.
 *
 * "Whenever you attack" fires once per combat in which you declared at least one attacker, not
 * once per attacker, and its target is chosen when the trigger goes on the stack — after attackers
 * are declared, so any attacking creature is a legal choice.
