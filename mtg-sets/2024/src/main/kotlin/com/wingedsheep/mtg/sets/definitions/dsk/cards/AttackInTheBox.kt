/**
 * Attack-in-the-Box
 * {3}
 * Artifact Creature — Toy
 * 2/4
 * Whenever this creature attacks, you may have it get +4/+0 until end of turn. If you do,
 * sacrifice it at the beginning of the next end step.
 *
 * Modeled as an attack trigger whose whole "+4/+0 and arm the delayed sacrifice" body is gated by
 * a single "you may" decision — so declining skips both the pump and the sacrifice ("if you do"
 * binds the sacrifice to the same yes choice, per the oracle text). The sacrifice is a delayed
 * trigger that fires at the next end step on [EffectTarget.Self].
