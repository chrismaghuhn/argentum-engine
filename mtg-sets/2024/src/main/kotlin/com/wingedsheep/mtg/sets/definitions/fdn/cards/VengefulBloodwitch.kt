 * Creature — Vampire Warlock
 * 1/1

 * "This creature or another creature you control" is exactly "a creature you control" (it
 * includes the source itself), so the trigger is `Triggers.a(GameObjectFilter.Creature.youControl()).dies()` — it fires off
 * the source's own death via last-known information just as for any other controlled creature.
