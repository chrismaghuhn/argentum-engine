/**
 * Cryptic Coat — Murders at Karlov Manor #50
 * {2}{U} · Artifact — Equipment
 *
 * When this Equipment enters, cloak the top card of your library, then attach this Equipment to it.
 * Equipped creature gets +1/+0 and can't be blocked.
 * {1}{U}: Return this Equipment to its owner's hand.
 *
 * The enters trigger is one pipeline, not two effects: [GatherCardsEffect] lifts the top card,
 * [MoveCollectionEffect] puts it onto the battlefield face down as a cloak ([FaceDownMode.CLOAK] —
 * a 2/2 with ward {2}, CR 701.58a), and `storeMovedAs` hands the *battlefield* entity id to the
 * attach step through [EffectTarget.PipelineTarget]. Attaching by id is what makes the "then" in
 * the oracle text real: the Coat lands on the very permanent this ability just created, with no
 * targeting and therefore no ward tax on itself.
 *
 * Cryptic Coat deliberately has **no equip ability** (Scryfall ruling 2024-02-02: "Without
 * assistance from other cards, there's no way to attach it to a creature other than with its first
 * triggered ability"), so nothing here calls `equipAbility`. The {1}{U} bounce is the card's whole
 * engine: return it, recast it, cloak another card.
 *
 * "Can't be blocked" is the unconditional [CantBeBlocked], not a `CantBeBlockedBy` restriction —
 * both halves of the static are scoped to [Filters.EquippedCreature] so they follow the Coat when
 * it moves.
