/**
 * Buried in the Garden — Murders at Karlov Manor #191
 * {2}{G}{W} · Enchantment — Aura
 *
 * Enchant land
 * When this Aura enters, exile target nonland permanent you don't control until this Aura leaves
 * the battlefield.
 * Whenever enchanted land is tapped for mana, its controller adds an additional one mana of any color.
 *
 * A Banishing Light stapled to a Fertile Ground, and both halves already have their shape here.
 * The removal is the standard [Effects.ExileUntilLeaves] / [Effects.ReturnLinkedExileUnderOwnersControl]
 * pair — the enters trigger links the exiled permanent to this Aura and the leaves trigger returns
 * it, which is what makes the three rulings fall out for free: the exile never happens if the Aura
 * is gone before the trigger resolves, the returning card is a new object (so counters and Auras on
 * it are lost), and an exiled token simply ceases to exist with nothing to return.
 *
 * The mana half is [AdditionalManaOnTap] with `anyColor = true` — the Fertile Ground shape, where
 * the controller picks the colour on each manual tap and the auto-tapper treats the bonus as
 * flexible when paying a cost. Note who gets the mana: the ability says *its controller*, so
 * enchanting an opponent's land hands them the bonus. That falls out of the static being keyed to
 * the tap rather than to this Aura's controller.
