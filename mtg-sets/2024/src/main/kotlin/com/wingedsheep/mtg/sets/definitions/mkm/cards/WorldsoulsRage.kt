/**
 * Worldsoul's Rage — Murders at Karlov Manor #244
 * {X}{R}{G} · Sorcery
 *
 * Worldsoul's Rage deals X damage to any target. Put up to X land cards from your hand and/or
 * graveyard onto the battlefield tapped.
 *
 * One X buys both halves, which is why the card is a ramp payoff rather than a burn spell: X=4 is a
 * four-point Rolling Thunder *and* four lands, so every point spent on the removal is also a point of
 * mana development. The lands come from either zone, so a stocked graveyard (fetch lands, Aftermath
 * Analyst) fuels it as well as a hand full of them.
 *
 * The two halves are one resolution, in printed order — damage first, then the lands. That ordering is
 * observable: the damage can kill a creature whose death fills the graveyard, but not in time to be
 * selected here, because the collection is gathered after the damage has already been dealt.
 *
 * "From your hand **and/or** graveyard" is a single decision over both zones, not two prompts:
 * `CardSource.FromMultipleZones` gathers them together and the client renders the choice with zone
 * labels (`MultiZoneSelectionUI`). A flat list would leave the player unable to tell a land in hand
 * from the same land in the graveyard.
 *
 * `SelectionMode.ChooseUpTo(DynamicAmount.XValue)` carries the printed "up to X" — fewer than X is
 * legal, and X=0 makes the whole spell a legal cast that deals no damage and puts no lands. The X here
 * is `XValue`, the transient cast-time payment read during this spell's own resolution, not the
 * object-scoped `CastX` a permanent would need.
 *
 * `ZonePlacement.Tapped` on the move step is what "onto the battlefield tapped" means — the same
 * placement MKM's own Aftermath Analyst uses for its graveyard-land return. Nothing here is a land
 * *play*, so the once-per-turn land drop is untouched and any number of lands can arrive.
