/**
 * Unyielding Gatekeeper — Murders at Karlov Manor #35
 * {1}{W} · Creature — Elephant Cleric · 3/2 · Rare
 *
 * Disguise {1}{W}
 * When this creature is turned face up, exile another target nonland permanent. If you controlled
 * it, return it to the battlefield tapped. Otherwise, its controller creates a 2/2 white and blue
 * Detective creature token.
 *
 * Two cards in one trigger: a blink for your own enters-the-battlefield permanent, or unconditional
 * exile removal for an opponent's — bought at the price of handing them a 2/2. Both halves are
 * bought at instant speed and can't be responded to, because turning a permanent face up is a
 * special action (CR 701.34a); the only window an opponent gets is with the trigger already on the
 * stack and its target locked in.
 *
 * **The branch is decided before the exile, not after.** "If you controlled it" is read as the
 * ability resolves, and both printed rulings turn on that: controlling the permanent earlier in the
 * turn doesn't count, and one you *do* control returns under **your** control regardless of who
 * owns it. [Effects.If] evaluates its condition up front as a synchronous state test, so
 * [Conditions.TargetMatchesFilter] still sees the permanent on the battlefield with its controller
 * intact. Each branch then does its own exile — hoisting the exile out of the conditional and
 * testing afterwards would be testing a controller that no longer exists.
 *
 * The return is [RestorationAngel]'s two-move blink with [ZonePlacement.Tapped], plus an explicit
 * `controllerOverride = EffectTarget.Controller`: the default return is under the card's *owner's*
 * control, which is the wrong player for the one case the second ruling calls out — a permanent you
 * control but don't own. A card that changes zones is a new object, so nothing survives the trip;
 * that is correct here, the printed card wants a fresh permanent.
 *
 * The consolation token uses [EffectTarget.TargetController], which reads last-known information
 * after the exile (the Bovine Intervention shape), so the opponent creates their own Detective per
 * CR 111.1. It takes its art from MKM's `tokenArt` layer, so no `imageUri` is baked in — the same
 * shape [ChalkOutline] and [InsideSource] use for theirs.
