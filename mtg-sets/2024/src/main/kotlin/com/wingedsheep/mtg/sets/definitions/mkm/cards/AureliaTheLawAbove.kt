/**
 * Aurelia, the Law Above

 * 4/4
 * Flying, vigilance, haste
 * Whenever a player attacks with three or more creatures, you draw a card.
 * Whenever a player attacks with five or more creatures, Aurelia deals 3 damage to each of your
 * opponents and you gain 3 life.
 *
 * Each ability observes the single declare-attackers event with an ANY binding. The attacker-count
 * predicate is evaluated from that event's declared-attacker snapshot, so removing an attacker in
 * response does not undo either trigger.
