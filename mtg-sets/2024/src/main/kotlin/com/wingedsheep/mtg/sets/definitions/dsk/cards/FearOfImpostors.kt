/**
 * Fear of Impostors
 * {1}{U}{U}
 * Enchantment Creature — Nightmare
 * 3/2
 * Flash
 * When this creature enters, counter target spell. Its controller manifests dread. (That player
 * looks at the top two cards of their library, then puts one onto the battlefield face down as a
 * 2/2 creature and the other into their graveyard. If it's a creature card, it can be turned face
 * up any time for its mana cost.)
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 * - The ETB targets a spell, counters it, then the countered spell's controller manifests dread.
 *   "Its controller" is [Player.ControllerOf] over the spell target; after the counter the spell
 *   card sits in its owner's graveyard, where `controllerOf` resolves to that owner (= the spell's
 *   caster for a normal spell), so the right player manifests.
 * - "That player manifests dread" reuses the shared [Patterns.Library.manifestDread] recipe, but
 *   run under the spell controller via [Effects.ForEachPlayer] over a single player. The iteration
 *   rebinds the body's controller to that player (CR — they look at their own library, choose, and
 *   the face-down 2/2 enters under their control), so no manifest-dread-for-another-player special
 *   case is needed.
