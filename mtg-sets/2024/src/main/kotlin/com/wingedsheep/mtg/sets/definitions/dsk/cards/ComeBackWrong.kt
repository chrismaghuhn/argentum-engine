/**
 * Come Back Wrong
 * {2}{B}
 * Sorcery
 * Destroy target creature. If a creature card is put into a graveyard this way, return it to the
 * battlefield under your control. Sacrifice it at the beginning of your next end step.
 *
 * Substituted into this group in place of Valgavoth's Onslaught, whose "manifest dread X times,
 * then put X +1/+1 counters on each of those creatures" needs a count-driven (dynamic-X) repeat
 * loop with cross-iteration accumulation of the manifested creatures — an engine feature that does
 * not yet exist (`add-feature` territory), so it was skipped rather than approximated.
 *
 * Pipeline (the Zero Point Ballad / Kheru Lich Lord shape):
 *   1. `GatherCards(ChosenTargets)` references the targeted creature.
 *   2. `MoveCollection(..., MoveType.Destroy, storeMovedAs = "died")` destroys it via the standard
 *      path; an indestructible target, or a token (which ceases to exist), drops out of `"died"` —
 *      that's the "if a creature card is put into a graveyard this way" gate.
 *   3. Select the nontoken creature card from `"died"` (SelectAll — no choice) and
 *      `MoveCollection` it to the battlefield under your control, recapturing it as
 *      `"comeBackWrong"`. With nothing in `"died"`, the select/move are no-ops.
 *   4. `CreateDelayedTrigger` at the next end step sacrifices the reanimated permanent
 *      ([EffectTarget.PipelineTarget]).
