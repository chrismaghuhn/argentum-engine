/**

 * Creature — Dragon
 * 3/5

 * Flying
 * If a source you control would deal damage to an opponent or a permanent an opponent
 * controls, it deals double that damage instead.
 *
 * The doubling is a [DoubleDamage] damage-amount replacement (CR 616), scoped by an
 * [EventPattern.DamageEvent] whose source is "any source you control" and whose recipient is
 * [Recipient.OpponentOrPermanentTheyControl] ("an opponent or a permanent an opponent
 * controls" — the same recipient shape used by Fated Firepower). Combat and noncombat damage
 * alike double, matching the unrestricted "deal damage" wording.
