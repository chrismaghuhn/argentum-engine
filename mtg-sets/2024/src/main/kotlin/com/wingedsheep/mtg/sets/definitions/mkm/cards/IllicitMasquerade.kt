/**
 * Illicit Masquerade — Murders at Karlov Manor #88
 *
 * The dies trigger's counter filter is evaluated from the zone-change event's last-known counters.
 * Its optional graveyard target excludes that triggering creature, which is still in the graveyard
 * when targets are chosen. On resolution the dead creature is exiled first, then the target is
 * returned; if the target has become illegal, normal target legality makes the whole ability fizzle
 * before the exile can happen.
