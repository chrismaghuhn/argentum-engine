/**
 * Silent Hallcreeper
 * {1}{U}
 * Enchantment Creature — Horror
 * 1/1
 *
 * This creature can't be blocked.
 * Whenever this creature deals combat damage to a player, choose one that hasn't been chosen —
 * • Put two +1/+1 counters on this creature.
 * • Draw a card.
 * • This creature becomes a copy of another target creature you control.
 *
 * "Choose one that hasn't been chosen" is modeled with [ModalEffect.chooseOneNotYetChosen]: the
 * engine remembers which modes this Hallcreeper has already chosen and never offers them again, so
 * across multiple combat-damage triggers each mode is used at most once. Once all three have been
 * chosen the ability does nothing.
 *
 * The copy mode targets "another target creature you control" ([Targets.OtherCreatureYouControl])
 * and makes this creature ([EffectTarget.Self], `affected`) become a copy of that target until it
 * leaves play (the copy is permanent per the card — no duration clause), copying copiable values
 * only (Rule 707).
