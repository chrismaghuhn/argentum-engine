/**
 * Kellan, Inquisitive Prodigy // Tail the Suspect — Murders at Karlov Manor #212
 *
 * Kellan's attack trigger checks who controlled the chosen artifact before destroying it. That
 * preserves the printed ruling that an indestructible artifact still draws a card for its
 * controller: destruction succeeding is not the condition. Tail the Suspect composes the existing
 * investigate and cumulative additional-land effects; the Adventure framework handles exile and
 * the later creature cast.
