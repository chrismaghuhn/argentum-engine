/**
 * Smoky Lounge // Misty Salon (DSK 235) — split-layout Room (CR 709.5).
 *
 * Smoky Lounge {2}{R} — Enchantment — Room
 *   At the beginning of your first main phase, add {R}{R}. Spend this mana only to cast Room spells
 *   and unlock doors.
 *
 * Misty Salon {3}{U} — Enchantment — Room
 *   When you unlock this door, create an X/X blue Spirit creature token with flying, where X is the
 *   number of unlocked doors among Rooms you control.
 *
 * Cast each half separately; the cast face enters unlocked, the other locked. Pay the locked
 * face's printed mana cost as a sorcery-speed special action to unlock it (CR 709.5e). Each face's
 * ability only functions while that door is unlocked.
 *
 * Smoky Lounge's restricted ritual is the existing [Effects.AddMana] with a
 * [ManaRestriction.AnyOf] over "cast a Room spell" ([ManaRestriction.SubtypeSpellsOnly]) and
 * "unlock a door" ([ManaRestriction.UnlockDoorOnly]) — the two ways the printed text lets you
 * spend it. Misty Salon's token uses [Effects.CreateDynamicToken] with
 * [DynamicAmounts.unlockedDoors] feeding both power and toughness; X is recomputed at resolution,
 * so the Misty Salon door that triggered (now unlocked) is itself counted (CR 709.5).
