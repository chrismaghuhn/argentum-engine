/**
 * Enduring Tenacity
 * {2}{B}{B}
 * Enchantment Creature — Snake Glimmer
 * 4/3
 * Whenever you gain life, target opponent loses that much life.
 * When Enduring Tenacity dies, if it was a creature, return it to the battlefield under its

 *
 * "That much" is the amount of life gained by the triggering life-gain event, read from the
 * trigger context as [ContextPropertyKey.TRIGGER_LIFE_GAINED]. The drain targets a single
 * opponent (CR: "target opponent"). The death clause is the Duskmourn "Enduring" mechanic —
 * see [enduring].
