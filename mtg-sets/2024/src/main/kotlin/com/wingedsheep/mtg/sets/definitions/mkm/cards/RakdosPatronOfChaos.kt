/**
 * Rakdos, Patron of Chaos — Murders at Karlov Manor #224
 * {4}{B}{R} · Legendary Creature — Demon · 6/6
 *
 * Flying, trample
 * At the beginning of your end step, target opponent may sacrifice two nonland, nontoken permanents
 * of their choice. If they don't, you draw two cards.
 *
 * A six-mana 6/6 flier that taxes the table every turn it survives: two real permanents or two cards,
 * chosen by the victim, every end step. In multiplayer the target is re-chosen each turn, so the tax
 * rotates.
 *
 * **The "may" is an opponent-side choice between two named actions**, which is exactly
 * [Effects.ChooseAction] with `player` set to the targeted opponent — the same shape as Terrapact
 * Intimidator's wording-identical "target opponent may … If they don't, …". Both halves are effects
 * the choosing player selects between, not a cost they pay, and that distinction is load-bearing here:
 *
 * - A `Effects.May(decisionMaker = opponent, otherwise = draw)` would prompt the right player, but the
 *   engine evaluates a gate's feasibility against the *ability's controller*, not the decision maker.
 *   Rakdos's controller having two spare permanents would then wrongly enable the option.
 * - Worse, `ForceSacrifice` auto-sacrifices when a player has at most `count` legal permanents, so an
 *   opponent who accepted while holding a single permanent would lose that one — sacrificing *one*
 *   where the card demands two. `ChooseAction` avoids both: its
 *   [FeasibilityCheck.ControlsPermanentMatching] is tested against the chooser, so an opponent who
 *   can't find two is never offered the option, the remaining choice auto-executes, and the draw
 *   happens without a prompt. That is the rules-correct outcome — they can't sacrifice two, so they
 *   don't, and "if they don't" fires.
 *
 * "Of their choice" is the default for `Effects.Sacrifice(…, target = opponent)`: the named player is
 * both the sacrificer and the chooser, prompted for exactly two permanents. `NonlandPermanent
 * .nontoken()` is the printed filter — tokens are excluded so a Clue-and-Treasure board can't buy its
 * way out cheaply.
 *
 * The draw is `EffectTarget.Controller`, not the trigger's target: "you" is Rakdos's controller.
 * Nothing in either branch refers back to Rakdos, so both still happen if it leaves the battlefield
 * after the trigger goes on the stack.
