/**
 * Coerced to Kill — Murders at Karlov Manor #192
 * {3}{U}{B} · Enchantment — Aura
 *
 * Enchant creature
 * You control enchanted creature.
 * Enchanted creature has base power and toughness 1/1, has deathtouch, and is an Assassin in
 * addition to its other types.
 *
 * Dimir's take on Control Magic: you take the creature *and* shrink it to a 1/1 deathtouch body. The
 * stolen creature stops being a threat on its own stats and becomes a repeatable trade — a 1/1 that
 * kills anything it touches, which is exactly what you want from a creature you're going to throw at
 * its former controller's board.
 *
 * Four separate statics because they land in four different layers, and the layer order is what
 * makes the card work:
 *  - [ControlEnchantedPermanent] — Layer 2 (CONTROL).
 *  - [GrantSubtype] "Assassin" — Layer 4 (TYPE), *in addition to* its other types, so a stolen
 *    Sphinx is a Sphinx Assassin.
 *  - [GrantKeyword] deathtouch — Layer 6 (ABILITY).
 *  - [SetBasePowerToughnessStatic] — Layer 7b (SET_BASE_VALUES). Being a *base* P/T set, it is
 *    applied before Layer 7c modifications, so +1/+1 counters and pump effects still add on top of
 *    the 1/1 rather than being erased by it.
 *
 * [SetBasePowerToughnessStatic] and [GrantKeyword] both default their filter to the attached
 * creature, which is what an Aura wants. [GrantSubtype] does **not** — it defaults to
 * `GroupFilter.source()`, which would make the *Aura* an Assassin and leave the creature untouched,
 * so the attached-creature filter is passed explicitly.
