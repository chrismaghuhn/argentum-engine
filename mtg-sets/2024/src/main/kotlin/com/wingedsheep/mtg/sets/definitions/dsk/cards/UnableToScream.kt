/**
 * Unable to Scream
 * {U}
 * Enchantment — Aura
 * Enchant creature
 * Enchanted creature loses all abilities and is a Toy artifact creature with base power and
 * toughness 0/2 in addition to its other types.
 * As long as enchanted creature is face down, it can't be turned face up.
 *
 * Modeled as a stack of statics on the attached creature:
 *  - [LoseAllAbilities] (Layer 6)
 *  - "Toy artifact creature in addition to its other types": [GrantCardType] ARTIFACT +
 *    [GrantSubtype] Toy (Layer 4; it's already a creature, so no need to add CREATURE)
 *  - [SetBasePowerToughnessStatic] 0/2 (Layer 7b)
 *  - [CantBeTurnedFaceUp] — only meaningful while face down (a face-up permanent can't be
 *    "turned face up"), so applied unconditionally; the turn-face-up special action reads it.
