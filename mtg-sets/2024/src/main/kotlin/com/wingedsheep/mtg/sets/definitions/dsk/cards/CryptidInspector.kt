/**
 * Cryptid Inspector
 * {2}{G}
 * Creature — Elf Warrior
 * 2/3
 * Vigilance
 * Whenever a face-down permanent you control enters and whenever this creature or another
 * permanent you control is turned face up, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature.
 *
 * The "X and whenever Y" templating is two distinct triggered abilities sharing one payoff
 * (CR has no "or" trigger combiner), so it's modelled as two `triggeredAbility` blocks, both
 * putting a +1/+1 counter on this creature ([EffectTarget.Self]):
 *  - a face-down permanent you control entering (`Triggers.a(filter).enters()` filtered to
 *    face-down permanents you control); and
 *  - any permanent you control (including this creature) being turned face up
 *    (`Triggers.<player>.permanentTurnedFaceUp(filter)` — in DSK every face-up turn is a manifested creature).
