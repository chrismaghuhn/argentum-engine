/**
 * Crystal Barricade
 * {1}{W}
 * Artifact Creature — Wall
 * 0/4
 * Defender
 * You have hexproof.
 * Prevent all noncombat damage that would be dealt to other creatures you control.
 *
 * Three printed abilities, each mapped to its own primitive:
 *  - Defender — plain keyword.
 *  - "You have hexproof" — the [GrantHexproofToController] static (Shalai, Voice of Plenty's
 *    player leg); it lives and dies with the Barricade being on the battlefield, so no cleanup.
 *  - The prevention shield — a continuous [PreventDamage] replacement (`amount = null` = prevent
 *    all) restricted to `DamageType.NonCombat` and to a recipient filter of creatures you control
 *    *other than the Barricade itself* (`notSourceItself()`; the Barricade's own damage is not
 *    prevented, and players aren't creatures so your own life total isn't shielded either). The
 *    filter is re-evaluated per damage instance against projected state, so creatures that come
 *    under your control later are covered.
