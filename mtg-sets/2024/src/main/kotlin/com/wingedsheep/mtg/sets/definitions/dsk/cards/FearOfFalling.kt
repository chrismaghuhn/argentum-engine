/**
 * Fear of Falling

 * Enchantment Creature — Nightmare
 * 4/4
 * Flying
 * Whenever this creature attacks, target creature defending player controls gets -2/-0 and
 * loses flying until your next turn.
 *
 * "Defending player controls" is modeled as `Targets.CreatureOpponentControls` — the same
 * convention attack-trigger cards use for the defending player in the engine's 1v1 combat
 * (cf. Swooping Talon's Provoke). The -2/-0 and flying loss share the `UntilYourNextTurn`
 * duration, composed as two floating effects on the chosen creature.
