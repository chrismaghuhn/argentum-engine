/**
 * Disturbing Mirth
 * {B}{R}
 * Enchantment
 * When this enchantment enters, you may sacrifice another enchantment or creature. If you do,
 * draw two cards.
 * When you sacrifice this enchantment, manifest dread. (Look at the top two cards of your library.
 * Put one onto the battlefield face down as a 2/2 creature and the other into your graveyard. Turn
 * it face up any time for its mana cost if it's a creature card.)
 *
 * First ability: "sacrifice another enchantment or creature" is a resolution-time choice, not a
 * target — the player accepts the optional first, then chooses which permanent, so declining never
 * commits anything. Only when a permanent is actually sacrificed does the "If you do, draw two
 * cards" payoff run. Modelled with [ReflexiveTriggerEffect] (optional sacrifice action, untargeted
 * draw payoff) — the same shape as Treetop Sentries / Unscrupulous Contractor.
 *
 * Second ability: the standard `Triggers.self.isSacrificed()` SELF trigger ("when you sacrifice this"),
 * reusing the shared [Patterns.Library.manifestDread] recipe (CR 701.62b).
