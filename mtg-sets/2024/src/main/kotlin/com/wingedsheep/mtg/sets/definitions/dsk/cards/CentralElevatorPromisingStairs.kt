/**
 * Central Elevator // Promising Stairs (DSK 44) — split-layout Room (CR 709.5).
 *
 * Central Elevator {3}{U} — Enchantment — Room
 *   When you unlock this door, search your library for a Room card that doesn't have the same
 *   name as a Room you control, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle.
 *
 * Promising Stairs {2}{U} — Enchantment — Room
 *   At the beginning of your upkeep, surveil 1. You win the game if there are eight or more
 *   different names among unlocked doors of Rooms you control.
 *
 * Cast each half separately; the cast face enters unlocked, the other locked. Pay the locked
 * face's printed mana cost as a sorcery-speed special action to unlock it (CR 709.5e).
 *
 * Notes:
 * - Central Elevator's search restriction is the new [GameObjectFilter.nameNotSharedWithControlledRoom]
 *   predicate. Per the 2024-09-20 ruling, only the names of *unlocked* doors of Rooms you control
 *   count; a split Room card in the library shares a name if either of its door names matches.
 * - Promising Stairs's win is a state-triggered ability (CR 603.8), checked continuously rather
 *   than only at upkeep — it triggers the moment you reach eight or more different unlocked-door
 *   names. The ruling clarifies it counts names, not permanents (a Room with two unlocked doors
 *   contributes two), which is exactly [DynamicAmount.UnlockedDoors] with `distinctNames = true`.
