/**
 * The Tale of Tamiyo
 * {2}{U}
 * Legendary Enchantment — Saga
 *
 * (As this Saga enters and after your draw step, add a lore counter. Sacrifice after IV.)
 * I, II, III — Mill two cards. If two cards that share a card type were milled this way, draw a
 *   card and repeat this process.
 * IV — Exile any number of target instant, sorcery, and/or Tamiyo planeswalker cards from your
 *   graveyard. Copy them. You may cast any number of the copies.
 *
 * Chapters I–III are a do-while loop ([Effects.RepeatWhile]): each pass mills two cards (stored
 * under the `milled` collection), and "if two cards that share a card type were milled this way"
 * ([Conditions.CollectionSharesCardType]) both draws a card and repeats. The repeat condition reads
 * the *current* pass's `milled` collection, so the loop ends as soon as a pass mills two cards with
 * no shared card type — or fewer than two cards (CR 205.2a; per the card's rulings supertypes and
 * subtypes are not card types).
 *
 * Chapter IV exiles any number of targeted graveyard cards, copies them as a group
 * ([Effects.CopyCollectionIntoCollection], the copies created in exile), then lets you cast any
 * number of those copies **paying their costs** ([Effects.CastAnyNumberFromCollection] — the
 * wording omits "without paying their mana costs", and an {X} copy prompts for X). Casts happen
 * during this resolution, so timing restrictions are ignored; copies left uncast cease to exist via
 * the Rule 707.10a state-based action.
