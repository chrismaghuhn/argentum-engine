/**
 * Agrus Kos, Spirit of Justice — Murders at Karlov Manor #184
 * {2}{R}{W} · Legendary Creature — Spirit Detective · 2/4
 *
 * Double strike, vigilance
 * Whenever Agrus Kos enters or attacks, choose up to one target creature. If it's suspected, exile
 * it. Otherwise, suspect it.
 *
 * A two-stage removal engine: the first hit hangs a suspect designation on a blocker (menace plus
 * "can't block", CR 701.60a), and any later hit — the same Agrus Kos attacking again, or a second
 * copy entering — cashes that designation in for an exile. Because Agrus Kos has vigilance, the
 * attack trigger costs nothing defensively, and double strike means the body it just disarmed is
 * exactly the one it wanted out of the way.
 *
 * **"Enters or attacks" is two triggered abilities, not one.** The SDK has no combined
 * enters-or-attacks trigger, so the ability is written twice over a shared effect factory — the same
 * shape [BenthicCriminologists] uses for the identical clause — one `TriggeredAbilityBuilder`
 * extension declaring the target and the rider, invoked from both blocks. That is also the rules-correct
 * reading: they are separate abilities that each trigger and target independently, so a turn where
 * Agrus Kos enters *and* attacks puts two abilities on the stack, each choosing its own target.
 *
 * **The branch reads the target at resolution, not at announcement.** `TargetMatchesFilter` over
 * `Creature.suspected()` is evaluated when the ability resolves, so a creature that was suspected on
 * announcement but had the designation stripped in between (Absolving Lammasu, Airtight Alibi) gets
 * suspected again rather than exiled — and vice versa. Modelling this as two modes chosen up front
 * would get that backwards. The condition is keyed on the *target index* rather than on the handle
 * `target(…)` returns: `ConditionEvaluator` resolves `ContextTarget` but not a bound variable, so a
 * handle-based condition would silently evaluate false and always take the suspect branch.
 *
 * `optional = true` carries the printed "up to one": declining is legal even with legal targets on
 * the board, which matters because suspecting an opponent's creature *helps* it get through as an
 * attacker. With no target chosen the ability resolves and does nothing.
 *
 * Suspect is deliberately permanent (`Effects.Suspect` defaults to `Duration.Permanent`) — per the
 * rulings a creature stays suspected until it leaves the battlefield or an effect un-suspects it.
 * Nothing about the exile branch refers to Agrus Kos, so it still happens if Agrus Kos dies to the
 * blocker's damage before the ability resolves.
