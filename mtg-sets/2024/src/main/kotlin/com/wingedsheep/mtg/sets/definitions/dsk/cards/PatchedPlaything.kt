/**
 * Patched Plaything
 * {2}{W}
 * Artifact Creature — Toy
 * 4/3
 * Double strike
 * This creature enters with two -1/-1 counters on it if you cast it from your hand.
 *
 * The conditional enter-with-counters is a replacement effect (CR 614.12) whose condition is
 * evaluated as the permanent enters: [Conditions.WasCastFromHand] reads the cast-origin marker
 * stamped on the resolving permanent, so the two -1/-1 counters appear only on a hand-cast (not when
 * it enters via a token-copy, reanimation, or any effect that puts it onto the battlefield without
 * casting it from hand).
