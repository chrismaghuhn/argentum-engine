/**
 * Sword of Wealth and Power
 * {3}
 * Artifact — Equipment
 *
 * Equipped creature gets +2/+2 and has protection from instants and from sorceries.
 * Whenever equipped creature deals combat damage to a player, create a Treasure token. When you
 * next cast an instant or sorcery spell this turn, copy that spell. You may choose new targets
 * for the copy.
 * Equip {2}
 *
 * Protection from a card type is granted via [GrantProtectionFromCardType] (one per type), enforced
 * at targeting by the engine. The combat-damage trigger binds to the equipped creature
 * ([TriggerBinding.ATTACHED]); the "create a Treasure" half plus the "copy your next instant or
 * sorcery" delayed trigger are the existing [Effects.CreateTreasure] and [Effects.CopyNextSpellCast]
 * primitives (the latter defaults to instant-or-sorcery and lets you choose new targets).
