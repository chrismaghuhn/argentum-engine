/**
 * Case of the Filched Falcon — Murders at Karlov Manor #44
 * {U} · Enchantment — Case · Uncommon
 *
 * When this Case enters, investigate.
 * To solve — You control three or more artifacts.
 * Solved — {2}{U}, Sacrifice this Case: Put four +1/+1 counters on target noncreature artifact.
 * It becomes a 0/0 Bird creature with flying in addition to its other types.
 *
 * The Case investigates itself most of the way to solved: the Clue it makes is one of the three
 * artifacts, and it is still there to be animated later.
 *
 * "In addition to its other types" needs no argument on the animate: `BecomeCreature` *adds* the
 * CREATURE type rather than replacing the type line, and `SetCreatureSubtypes` strips only creature
 * subtypes — so with no `removeTypes` the artifact retains every type, subtype and supertype it
 * had, and a Clue stays a Clue and a Vehicle stays a Vehicle. Only its base power and toughness are
 * overwritten with 0/0 (which is why crewing an animated Vehicle afterwards can't restore its
 * printed P/T). The four counters are what keep it alive; without them the state-based actions
 * would bin a 0/0 immediately, so they are placed in the same resolution.
 *
 * `Duration.Permanent` — the printed text has no "until end of turn", and the Case is sacrificed
 * paying the cost, so nothing is left to hold a source-keyed duration open.
