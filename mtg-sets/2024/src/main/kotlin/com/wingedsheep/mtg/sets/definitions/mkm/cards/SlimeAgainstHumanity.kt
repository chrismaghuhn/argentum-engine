/**
 * Slime Against Humanity — Murders at Karlov Manor #177
 * {2}{G} · Sorcery · Common
 *
 * The Ooze-or-name test is one union filter reused for both relevant zones. The resolving spell is
 * still on the stack, so it does not count itself; face-down exiled cards have no matching name or
 * subtype. The token creator publishes the new Ooze through [CREATED_TOKENS], allowing the counter
 * effect to address exactly that token after it enters.
 *
 * The final sentence is a deck-construction allowance and requires no in-game script.
