/**
 * Case of the Burning Masks — Murders at Karlov Manor #113
 * {1}{R}{R} · Enchantment — Case · Uncommon
 *
 * When this Case enters, it deals 3 damage to target creature an opponent controls.
 * To solve — Three or more sources you controlled dealt damage this turn.
 * Solved — Sacrifice this Case: Exile the top three cards of your library. Choose one of them.
 * You may play that card this turn.
 *
 * "Three or more **sources**" counts objects, not damage events, which is what
 * [Conditions.SourcesYouControlledDealtDamageThisTurn] reads: the engine records each source on
 * the player who controlled it *at the moment it dealt damage*, so all four printed rulings hold —
 * a source that dies or changes hands afterwards still counts, a creature that deals damage three
 * times counts once, an ability is not itself a source (its source is the object it came from),
 * and a permanent that left the battlefield and came back is a new object and counts again. The
 * Case's own enters trigger is one of the three.
 *
 * The Solved ability is impulse-draw-with-a-choice: exile three, then choose exactly one, and only
 * that one gets the play permission. The other two stay exiled and unplayable, which is why this
 * isn't `Patterns.Exile.impulse(3)` (that grants permission to all of them).
