/**
 * Judith, Carnage Connoisseur — Murders at Karlov Manor #210
 * {3}{B}{R} · Legendary Creature — Human Shaman · 3/4
 *
 * Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell, choose one —
 * • That spell gains deathtouch and lifelink.
 * • Create a 2/2 red Imp creature token with "When this token dies, it deals 2 damage to each
 *   opponent."
 *
 * A cast trigger with two payoffs that want opposite kinds of spell: mode one turns a burn spell
 * into removal-plus-drain, mode two banks value off a spell that was never going to deal damage
 * (a counterspell, a tutor) — so the choice is made per cast, not per Judith.
 *
 * Modelled as a [ModalEffect] hanging off `Triggers.you.casts(GameObjectFilter.InstantOrSorcery)`. The engine picks the
 * mode when the *ability resolves* rather than when it's put on the stack (CR 601.2b via 603.3d);
 * that is the existing convention for every modal triggered ability in the corpus (Faces of the
 * Past), and it is unobservable here because the ability resolves before the spell that triggered
 * it either way.
 *
 * Mode one is two [Effects.GrantKeywordToSpell] grants onto [EffectTarget.TriggeringEntity] — the
 * spell object still on the stack, not a permanent. Static keyword projection only reaches
 * battlefield permanents, so both keywords have to be read back off the spell-grant channel when
 * the spell deals its damage; the lifelink half of that read already existed, the deathtouch half
 * is added in this change (`DamageUtils.sourceHasDeathtouch`). Per the rulings, the spell must
 * *itself* deal the damage: a spell that tells another object to deal damage keeps neither keyword's
 * benefit, which falls out for free because the damage source is then that other object.
 *
 * Mode two's Imp carries its death trigger as a token-level [TriggeredAbility] rather than a
 * granted static, so the token is self-contained and a copy of it keeps the trigger.
