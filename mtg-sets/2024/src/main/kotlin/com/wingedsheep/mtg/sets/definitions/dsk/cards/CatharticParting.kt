/**
 * Cathartic Parting
 * {1}{G}
 * Sorcery
 * The owner of target artifact or enchantment an opponent controls shuffles it into their library.
 * You may shuffle up to four target cards from your graveyard into your library.
 *
 * Both clauses move cards to their owner's library shuffled — [Effects.ShuffleIntoLibrary] always
 * goes to the owner's library, so the opponent's permanent returns to the opponent's library and
 * your graveyard cards return to yours. The graveyard clause is "you may … up to four target
 * cards", modeled as an optional multi-target requirement (choosing zero is legal). Unchosen
 * indexed targets resolve to nothing and are skipped.
