/**
 * Miasma Demon — Duskmourn: House of Horror #109
 * {4}{B}{B} · Creature — Demon · 5/4
 *
 * Flying
 * When this creature enters, you may discard any number of cards. When you do, up to that many
 * target creatures each get -2/-2 until end of turn.
 *
 * Modeled as a [ReflexiveTriggerEffect]: the action is "discard any number of cards"
 * ([Patterns.Hand.discardAnyNumber], which stores the discarded set so its size is readable as
 * `discarded_count`), and the reflexive payoff selects up to that many target creatures —
 * [TargetCreature.dynamicMaxCount] = `Patterns.Hand.discarded.count`, resolved
 * against the resolving ability's pipeline when the reflexive targets are chosen (after the
 * discard). [ForEachTargetEffect] applies -2/-2 until end of turn to each chosen creature.
 *
 * Per CR 603.10c / the oracle "when you do" reflexive shape, the payoff fires off the discard
 * action itself; discarding zero cards means there is no "that many", so the reflexive trigger
 * targets nothing — handled by `optional = false` on the reflexive wrapper (the action is the
 * "may", a discard of zero is a legal no-op) combined with the 0-cap on targets.
