/**
 * Ghostly Keybearer — Duskmourn: House of Horror #61
 * {3}{U}
 * Creature — Spirit
 * 3/3
 *
 * Flying
 * Whenever this creature deals combat damage to a player, unlock a locked door of up to one
 * target Room you control.
 *
 * The combat-damage trigger uses the resolution-time "unlock a door" effect (CR 709.5f): it gives
 * a locked half of the targeted Room the "unlocked" designation, firing that face's "When you
 * unlock this door" triggers (CR 709.5h) exactly as the unlock-cost special action would. "Up to
 * one target Room you control" is an optional `TargetObject` restricted to a Room with a locked
 * door — a fully-unlocked Room has nothing left to unlock, so it isn't a legal target, and the
 * controller may also choose no target.
