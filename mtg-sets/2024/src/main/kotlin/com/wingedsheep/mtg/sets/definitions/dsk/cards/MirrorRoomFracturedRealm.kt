/**
 * Mirror Room // Fractured Realm (DSK 67) — split-layout Room (CR 709.5).
 *
 * Mirror Room {2}{U} — Enchantment — Room
 *   When you unlock this door, create a token that's a copy of target creature you control,
 *   except it's a Reflection in addition to its other creature types.
 *
 * Fractured Realm {5}{U}{U} — Enchantment — Room
 *   If a triggered ability of a permanent you control triggers, that ability triggers an
 *   additional time.
 *
 * Cast each half separately; the cast face enters unlocked, the other locked. Pay the locked
 * face's printed mana cost as a sorcery-speed special action to unlock it (CR 709.5e).
 *
 * The back face says "a permanent you control" — not "another" — so Fractured Realm doubles
 * its own triggered abilities too (excludeSelf = false). It has no triggers of its own, but the
 * intent is faithful to the literal text.
