/**
 * Krenko, Baron of Tin Street — Murders at Karlov Manor #135
 * {2}{R} · Legendary Creature — Goblin · 3/3
 *
 * The activated ability snapshots all Goblins its controller currently controls and puts one
 * counter on each. Sacrificing an artifact is part of the cost, so that zone change can also
 * trigger Krenko's second ability before the activated ability resolves.
 *
 * The graveyard trigger is ANY-bound and intentionally has no controller restriction: artifacts
 * belonging to any player count. The optional payment is made on resolution. The created Goblin's
 * haste is a temporary grant through the created-token pipeline rather than a printed token
 * keyword, so a surviving token correctly loses haste at cleanup.
