/**
 * Deadly Cover-Up — Murders at Karlov Manor #83
 * {3}{B}{B} · Sorcery · Rare
 *
 * The optional collect-evidence cost records the standard cast choice. On resolution the wipe
 * always happens first. Only the paid branch gathers one card from all opponents' graveyards; its
 * owner is snapshotted before exile, then becomes the per-player context for the graveyard, hand,
 * and library search. Counting the hand subset before moving the chosen cards preserves the exact
 * number of replacement draws.
