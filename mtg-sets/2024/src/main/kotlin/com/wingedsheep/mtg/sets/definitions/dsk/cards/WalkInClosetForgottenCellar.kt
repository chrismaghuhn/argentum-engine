/**
 * Walk-In Closet // Forgotten Cellar (DSK 205) — split-layout Room (CR 709.5).
 *
 * Walk-In Closet {2}{G} — Enchantment — Room
 *   You may play lands from your graveyard.
 *
 * Forgotten Cellar {3}{G}{G} — Enchantment — Room
 *   When you unlock this door, you may cast spells from your graveyard this turn, and if a card
 *   would be put into your graveyard from anywhere this turn, exile it instead.
 *
 * Cast each half separately; the cast face enters unlocked, the other locked. Pay the locked
 * face's printed mana cost as a sorcery-speed special action to unlock it (CR 709.5e).
 *
 * Walk-In Closet is the durable static [MayPlayLandsFromGraveyard]. Forgotten Cellar's unlock
 * trigger grants two *durational* riders until end of turn — the runtime siblings of Festival of
 * Embers' printed abilities: [Effects.GrantStaticAbility] of [MayCastFromGraveyard] (read by the
 * graveyard-cast enumerator/resolver alongside printed grants) and [Effects.GrantReplacementEffect]
 * of [RedirectZoneChange] to exile (read by the zone-change redirect path). The cast permission is
 * filtered to [GameObjectFilter.Nonland] so it grants "cast spells", not land plays.
