/**
 * Anzrag, the Quake-Mole — Murders at Karlov Manor #186
 * {2}{R}{G} · Legendary Creature — Mole God · 8/4
 *
 * Whenever Anzrag becomes blocked, untap each creature you control. After this phase, there is an
 * additional combat phase.
 * {3}{R}{R}{G}{G}: Anzrag must be blocked each combat this turn if able.
 *
 * The two halves are a loop by design: pay the activation, Anzrag is forced through a block, the
 * becomes-blocked trigger untaps the team and queues another combat, and the block requirement is
 * still there for that combat too. That last part is why the activated ability uses
 * [MustBeBlockedEffect] rather than a one-combat requirement — `MustBeBlockedExecutor` installs a
 * `Duration.EndOfTurn` floating effect, so the requirement outlives the combat phase it was
 * activated in and applies again in each additional one, exactly as "each combat this turn" prints.
 *
 * `allCreatures = false` is the Gaea's-Protector reading, not the Lure reading: the printed text is
 * "must be blocked … if able" (at least one blocker), not "all creatures able to block it do so".
 *
 * The untap is `ForEachInGroup` over creatures you control rather than a targeted untap — the
 * trigger targets nothing, so it can't be fizzled and doesn't care about hexproof.
 * [Effects.AddCombatPhase] is the atomic extra-combat piece with no trailing main phase, which is
 * what "After this phase, there is an additional combat phase" prints (CR 500.8).
