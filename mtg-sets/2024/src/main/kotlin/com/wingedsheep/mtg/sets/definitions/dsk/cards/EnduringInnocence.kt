/**
 * Enduring Innocence
 * {1}{W}{W}
 * Enchantment Creature — Sheep Glimmer
 * 2/1
 * Lifelink
 * Whenever one or more other creatures you control with power 2 or less enter, draw a card.
 *   This ability triggers only once each turn.
 * When Enduring Innocence dies, if it was a creature, return it to the battlefield under its
 *   owner's control. It's an enchantment. (It's not a creature.)
 *
 * "One or more ... This ability triggers only once each turn" — modeled as a per-creature
 * "another creature you control with power 2 or less enters" trigger gated `oncePerTurn`. The
 * once-per-turn cap makes the per-creature shape behaviorally identical to the printed batch:
 * the first matching enter each turn draws, and any further (including simultaneous) matches are
 * suppressed for the rest of the turn.
 *
 * The death clause is the Duskmourn "Enduring" mechanic — see [enduring].
