/**
 * Branch of Vitu-Ghazi — Murders at Karlov Manor #258
 * Land
 *
 * Although this is a land, disguise permits it to be cast face down as the standard colorless 2/2
 * creature with ward {2}. Turning it face up is legal because the disguise procedure exposes the
 * land's printed disguise cost; after the special action, the permanent is simply a land again.
 *
 * Its trigger adds two mana of one chosen color with the engine's end-of-turn expiry, so exactly
 * that mana persists through intervening step and phase boundaries. The ordinary colorless mana
 * ability remains a mana ability and therefore does not use the stack.
