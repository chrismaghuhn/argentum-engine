/**
 * Fear of Immobility
 * {4}{W}
 * Enchantment Creature — Nightmare
 * 4/4
 * When this creature enters, tap up to one target creature. If an opponent controls that creature,
 * put a stun counter on it. (If a permanent with a stun counter would become untapped, remove one
 * from it instead.)
 *
 * "Up to one target creature" → an optional [TargetCreature]; the creature is always tapped, and
 * the stun counter is gated at resolution on the target being controlled by an opponent via
 * [Conditions.TargetMatchesFilter] over [GameObjectFilter.Creature.opponentControls]. Tapping a
 * creature you control gives no stun counter, matching the printed text.
