/**
 * Unwanted Remake
 * {W}
 * Instant
 * Destroy target creature. Its controller manifests dread. (That player looks at the top two cards
 * of their library, then puts one onto the battlefield face down as a 2/2 creature and the other
 * into their graveyard. If it's a creature card, it can be turned face up any time for its mana
 * cost.)
 *
 * Modeled with existing primitives — the [FearOfImpostors] "its controller manifests dread" shape:
 * - [Effects.Destroy] destroys the targeted creature.
 * - "Its controller manifests dread" runs the shared [Patterns.Library.manifestDread] recipe under
 *   the destroyed creature's controller via [Effects.ForEachPlayer] over the single
 *   [Player.ControllerOf] the target. The iteration rebinds the body's controller to that player, so
 *   they look at their own library, choose, and the face-down 2/2 enters under their control.
 *   `Player.ControllerOf` resolves from the chosen target even after the destroy, since target ids
 *   are captured at resolution.
 * - Per the Scryfall ruling, an illegal target on resolution fizzles the whole spell (no manifest
 *   dread) — the standard targeting behavior, no special casing needed.
