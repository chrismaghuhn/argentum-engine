/**
 * Izoni, Center of the Web
 * {4}{B}{G}
 * Legendary Creature — Elf Detective
 * 5/4
 *
 * Menace
 * Whenever Izoni enters or attacks, you may collect evidence 4. If you do, create two 2/1 black
 * and green Spider creature tokens with reach and menace.
 * Sacrifice four tokens: Surveil 2, then draw two cards. You gain 2 life.
 *
 * "Enters or attacks" is represented by two triggered abilities sharing the same immutable payoff.
 * The ordinary, non-reflexive "if you do" clause is an [Effects.MayPay]: collecting evidence is
 * the optional payment, and the tokens are created only after that payment completes. The activated
 * ability pays its four-token sacrifice before resolving the surveil, draw, and life-gain sequence.
