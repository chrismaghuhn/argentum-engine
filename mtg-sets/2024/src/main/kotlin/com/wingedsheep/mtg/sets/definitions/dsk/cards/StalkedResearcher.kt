/**
 * Stalked Researcher
 * {1}{U}
 * Creature — Human Wizard
 * 3/3
 * Defender
 * Eerie — Whenever an enchantment you control enters and whenever you fully unlock a Room,
 * this creature can attack this turn as though it didn't have defender.
 *
 * The "X and whenever Y" Eerie templating is two distinct triggered abilities sharing one
 * payoff (CR has no "or" trigger combiner), modelled like the other DSK Eerie creatures
 * (e.g. Optimistic Scavenger): one block fires when an enchantment you control enters
 * (`Triggers.a(filter).enters()` filtered to enchantments you control), the other when you
 * fully unlock a Room (`Triggers.you.fullyUnlocksARoom()`). Both grant this creature
 * [Effects.CanAttackDespiteDefenderThisTurn] (the turn-scoped counterpart to the static
 * CanAttackDespiteDefender), which lets it attack as though it didn't have defender for the turn.
