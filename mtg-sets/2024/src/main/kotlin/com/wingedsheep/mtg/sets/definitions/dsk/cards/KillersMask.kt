 * When this Equipment enters, manifest dread, then attach this Equipment to that creature. (Look at
 * the top two cards of your library. Put one onto the battlefield face down as a 2/2 creature and the
 * other into your graveyard. Turn it face up any time for its mana cost if it's a creature card.)
 * Equipped creature has menace.

 * Manifest dread (CR 701.62) stores the manifested creature under the pipeline collection
 * "manifestDreadManifested" (see [Patterns.Library.manifestDread]); the follow-up attach targets
 * that creature via [EffectTarget.PipelineTarget]. If the library is empty (no creature is
 * manifested), there is nothing to attach and the attach step is a no-op.
