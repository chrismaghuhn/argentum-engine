/**
 * Fishing Pole
 * {1}
 * Artifact — Equipment
 *
 * Equipped creature has "{1}, {T}, Tap Fishing Pole: Put a bait counter on Fishing Pole."
 * Whenever equipped creature becomes untapped, remove a bait counter from this Equipment.
 * If you do, create a 1/1 blue Fish creature token.
 * Equip {2}
 *
 * Three different objects are involved in the granted ability, which is why it needs the
 * granter-scoped cost and target rather than plain `Self`:
 *  - `{T}` taps the **equipped creature** (the ability's host, [Costs.Tap]),
 *  - "Tap Fishing Pole" taps the **Equipment** ([Costs.TapGrantingPermanent]),
 *  - "Put a bait counter on Fishing Pole" puts them on the **Equipment**
 *    ([EffectTarget.GrantingSource]).
 *
 * Per the printed ruling (below) each of those names the *granting* Fishing Pole specifically
 * (CR 201.5a), so a second Fishing Pole on the battlefield is untouched — which is exactly what
 * the granter-relative cost and target give, as opposed to a name/type filter.
 *
 * The counters are spent by an ATTACHED-bound "becomes untapped" trigger. Tapping the Equipment
 * to bait it means the pole can only be baited once per untap cycle, and the trigger's
 * [Effects.IfYouDo] correctly makes no Fish when there is no bait counter to remove.
