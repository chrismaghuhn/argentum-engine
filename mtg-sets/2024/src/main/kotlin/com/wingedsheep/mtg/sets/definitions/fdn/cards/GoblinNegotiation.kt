/**
 * Goblin Negotiation

 * Sorcery
 *
 * Goblin Negotiation deals X damage to target creature. Create a number of 1/1 red Goblin
 * creature tokens equal to the amount of excess damage dealt to that creature this way.
 *
 * Composed from existing atoms (mirrors Hell to Pay): [Effects.DealXDamage] deals X to the target
 * and marks the damage, then [Effects.CreateToken] reads the post-damage excess via
 * `EntityProperty(EffectTarget.ContextTarget(0), ExcessMarkedDamage)` — `max(0, marked − toughness)`
 * (CR 120.4a). CompositeEffect resolves its steps sequentially with no interleaved SBA pass, so
 * the marked damage in scope at the second step is exactly the X this spell just dealt.
