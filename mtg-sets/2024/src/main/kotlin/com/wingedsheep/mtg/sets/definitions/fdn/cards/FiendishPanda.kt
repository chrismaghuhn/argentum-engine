/**
 * Fiendish Panda
 * {2}{W}{B}
 * Creature — Bear Demon
 * 3/2
 *
 * Whenever you gain life, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature.
 * When this creature dies, return another target non-Bear creature card with mana value less than
 * or equal to this creature's power from your graveyard to the battlefield.
 *
 * The life-gain trigger fires per life-gain event (`Triggers.you.gainsLife()`) and adds a +1/+1
 * counter. The dies trigger reanimates a graveyard creature: the target is a creature card in
 * **your** graveyard, not a Bear ([notSubtype]), whose mana value is at most Fiendish Panda's
 * power — a dynamic cap read via [DynamicAmount.EntityProperty] on the source's power, which falls
 * back to the last-known power captured at death (Fiendish Panda is already in the graveyard when
 * the trigger resolves, CR 603.10). `.other()` enforces "another" so the Panda can't reanimate
 * itself even once its power has climbed to meet its own mana value.
