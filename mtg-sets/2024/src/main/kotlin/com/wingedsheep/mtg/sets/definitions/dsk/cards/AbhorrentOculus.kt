/**
 * Abhorrent Oculus
 * {2}{U}
 * Creature — Eye
 * 5/5
 * As an additional cost to cast this spell, exile six cards from your graveyard.
 * Flying
 * At the beginning of each opponent's upkeep, manifest dread. (Look at the top two cards of your
 * library. Put one onto the battlefield face down as a 2/2 creature and the other into your
 * graveyard. Turn it face up any time for its mana cost if it's a creature card.)
 *
 * The graveyard exile is an [AdditionalCost.ExileFrom] over six cards from your graveyard
 * (CR 601.2f — paid as the spell is cast), so the spell can't be cast without six cards to exile.
 * The upkeep payoff reuses [Patterns.Library.manifestDread] (CR 701.62).
