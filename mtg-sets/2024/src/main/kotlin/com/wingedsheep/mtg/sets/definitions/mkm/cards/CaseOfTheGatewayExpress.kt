/**
 * Case of the Gateway Express — Murders at Karlov Manor #8
 * {1}{W} · Enchantment — Case · Uncommon
 *
 * When this Case enters, choose target creature you don't control. Each creature you control deals
 * 1 damage to that creature.
 * To solve — Three or more creatures attacked this turn.
 * Solved — Creatures you control get +1/+0.
 *
 * The ETB is a group ping, and *who* deals the damage matters: each creature you control is its own
 * damage source, so a deathtouch or lifelink creature in the group applies its own keyword to its
 * own point. That is [Effects.ForEachInGroup] with `damageSource = EffectTarget.IterationEntity` — inside a
 * group iteration `IterationEntity` binds to the iterated creature, not to the Case — rather than one lump of
 * damage from the enchantment.
 *
 * "Three or more creatures attacked this turn" names no player, so it is
 * [Conditions.CreaturesAttackedThisTurn] (the union of every player's attack record) rather than
 * the controller-scoped `YouAttackedWithCreaturesThisTurn`. The two agree in practice — only the
 * active player declares attackers, and the trigger checks at the Case's controller's own end step
 * — but the printed text is the player-agnostic one, and a creature whose controller changed after
 * it attacked still counts either way, because the record is keyed to the player who declared it.
