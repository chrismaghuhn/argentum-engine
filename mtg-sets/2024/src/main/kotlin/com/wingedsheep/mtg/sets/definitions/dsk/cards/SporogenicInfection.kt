/**
 * Sporogenic Infection
 * {1}{B}
 * Enchantment — Aura
 * Enchant creature
 * When this Aura enters, target player sacrifices a creature of their choice other than enchanted
 * creature.
 * When enchanted creature is dealt damage, destroy it.
 *
 * Standard Aura wiring: [auraTarget] enchants a creature (Targets.Creature), then two triggered
 * abilities. The enters trigger is an edict — it names its own "target player" and forces that
 * player to sacrifice a creature *of their choice* (the default [Effects.Sacrifice] / ForceSacrifice
 * behaviour) restricted to a creature other than the one this Aura is attached to via the
 * source-relative [GameObjectFilter.notAttachedToBySource] exclusion. The damage trigger uses the
 * shared `Triggers.<subject>.isDealtDamage(by)` factory with [TriggerBinding.ATTACHED] ("enchanted creature is dealt
 * damage") and destroys it via [EffectTarget.EnchantedCreature].
