/**
 * Overlord of the Hauntwoods
 * {3}{G}{G}
 * Enchantment Creature — Avatar Horror
 * 6/5
 *
 * Impending 4—{1}{G}{G} (If you cast this spell for its impending cost, it enters with four
 * time counters and isn't a creature until the last is removed. At the beginning of your
 * end step, remove a time counter from it.)
 *
 * Whenever this permanent enters or attacks, create a tapped colorless land token named
 * Everywhere that is every basic land type.
 *
 * Impending is wired by the `impending(n, cost)` DSL helper (CR 702.176): the alternative
 * cost, the "isn't a creature while it has a time counter" type-removing static ability, and
 * the "remove a time counter at the beginning of your end step" trigger. The engine places
 * the four time counters when the spell is cast for its impending cost.
 *
 * The Everywhere token is a predefined token (see PredefinedTokens.Everywhere): a land with
 * all five basic land subtypes that taps for any color. Per the Scryfall ruling it has the
 * mana ability of each basic land type and does not have the basic supertype. The "enters or
 * attacks" ability is one effect referenced by both the enters and attacks triggers.
