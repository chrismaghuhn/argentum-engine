/**
 * Unnerving Grasp

 * Sorcery
 * Return up to one target nonland permanent to its owner's hand. Manifest dread. (Look at the top
 * two cards of your library. Put one onto the battlefield face down as a 2/2 creature and the other
 * into your graveyard. Turn it face up any time for its mana cost if it's a creature card.)
 *
 * "Up to one target nonland permanent" → an optional [TargetPermanent] over
 * [TargetFilter.NonlandPermanent]; the bounce is skipped when no target is chosen and the manifest
 * dread still happens. The two effects are an ordered [Effects.Composite] (bounce, then the shared
 * [Patterns.Library.manifestDread] recipe), matching the printed sequence.
