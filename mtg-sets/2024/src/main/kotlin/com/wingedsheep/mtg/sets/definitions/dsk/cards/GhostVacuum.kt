/**
 * Ghost Vacuum
 * {1}
 * Artifact
 *
 * {T}: Exile target card from a graveyard.
 * {6}, {T}, Sacrifice this artifact: Put each creature card exiled with this artifact onto the
 * battlefield under your control with a flying counter on it. Each of them is a 1/1 Spirit in
 * addition to its other types. Activate only as a sorcery.
 *
 * First ability: exiles a target card from any graveyard, linked to this artifact
 * ([MoveToZoneEffect.linkToSource]) so the second ability can find the pile it built up.
 *
 * Second ability follows the proven [com.wingedsheep.mtg.sets.definitions.eoe.cards.PinnacleStarcage]
 * shape: the linked-exile pile is gathered (filtered to creature cards via the move's [filter]) and
 * the artifact is sacrificed *within the resolving effect* via [Effects.SacrificeTarget] rather than
 * as a paid cost. This is functionally identical to "Sacrifice this artifact" as a cost — nothing
 * references the artifact after the gather, and gathering before the sacrifice keeps the
 * `LinkedExileComponent` available (CR 400.7) — while reusing the battle-tested pattern.
 *
 * The returned creatures enter under your control with a flying counter ([MoveCollectionEffect.addCounterType]
 * = [CounterType.FLYING], which the projector maps to the flying keyword), then a per-permanent
 * iteration over the moved collection ([IterationSpace.Collection]) sets each one's base power and
 * toughness to 1/1 and adds the Spirit creature type, both for [Duration.Permanent] (the lasting
 * "is a 1/1 Spirit in addition to its other types" effect, which persists after the artifact is gone).
