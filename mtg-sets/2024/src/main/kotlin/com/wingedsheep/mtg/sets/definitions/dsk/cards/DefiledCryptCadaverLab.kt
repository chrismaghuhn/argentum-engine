/**
 * Defiled Crypt // Cadaver Lab (DSK 91) — split-layout Room (CR 709.5).
 *
 * Defiled Crypt {3}{B} — Enchantment — Room
 *   Whenever one or more cards leave your graveyard, create a 2/2 black Horror enchantment
 *   creature token. This ability triggers only once each turn.
 *
 * Cadaver Lab {B} — Enchantment — Room
 *   When you unlock this door, return target creature card from your graveyard to your hand.
 *
 * Cast each half separately; the cast face enters unlocked, the other locked. Pay the locked
 * face's printed mana cost as a sorcery-speed special action to unlock it (CR 709.5e).
 *
 * Defiled Crypt reuses the batching `Triggers.oneOrMore(filter).leaveYourGraveyard()` leave-graveyard trigger
 * with `oncePerTurn = true` for "This ability triggers only once each turn" (the tracker is
 * cleared at end of turn). The token is an enchantment creature, modeled via
 * `enchantmentToken = true`. Cadaver Lab is a "when you unlock this door" trigger (CR 709.5h)
 * returning a target creature card from the controller's own graveyard.
