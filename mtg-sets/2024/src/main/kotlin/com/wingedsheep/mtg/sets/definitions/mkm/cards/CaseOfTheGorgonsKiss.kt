/**
 * Case of the Gorgon's Kiss — Murders at Karlov Manor #79
 * {B} · Enchantment — Case · Uncommon
 *
 * When this Case enters, destroy up to one target creature that was dealt damage this turn.
 * To solve — Three or more creature cards were put into graveyards from anywhere this turn.
 * Solved — This Case is a 4/4 Gorgon creature with deathtouch and lifelink in addition to its
 * other types.
 *
 * "Up to one target" is `optional = true`, not a mandatory target: a board where nothing has been
 * damaged still lets the Case enter and its trigger resolve doing nothing.
 *
 * The "to solve" count is game-wide — "put into graveyard**s**", not "your graveyard" — so it is
 * [Conditions.CreatureCardsPutIntoGraveyardsThisTurn], which sums every player's tracker. Two
 * printed rulings fall out of how that tracker works: it reads the card's own type line, i.e. what
 * the card *is in the graveyard*, so a creature card that had become a noncreature permanent still
 * counts and an animated noncreature card does not; and tokens never count, because a token isn't
 * a card (CR 111.6).
 *
 * The Solved line is five statics rather than one animate effect, the same decomposition Kaito
 * uses: add the CREATURE type ("in addition to its other types", so nothing is removed), add the
 * Gorgon subtype, set base power and toughness, and grant the two keywords. Written as continuous
 * abilities they switch off again the moment the Case stops being solved — which can only happen
 * by it leaving the battlefield, but it is also what keeps a copy of this Case a plain enchantment.
