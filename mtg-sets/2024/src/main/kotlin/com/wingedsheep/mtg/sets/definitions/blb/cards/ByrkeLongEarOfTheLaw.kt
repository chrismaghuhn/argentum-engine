/**
 * Byrke, Long Ear of the Law
 * {4}{G}{W}
 * Legendary Creature — Rabbit Soldier
 * 4/4
 *
 * Vigilance
 * When Byrke enters, put a +1/+1 counter on each of up to two target creatures.
 * Whenever a creature you control with a +1/+1 counter on it attacks, double the
 * number of +1/+1 counters on it.
 *
 * The ETB mirrors Weftblade Enhancer's "each of up to two target creatures" shape —
 * an optional `count = 2` [TargetCreature] fanned out with [ForEachTargetEffect] so
 * each chosen creature gets one counter. The attack trigger fires for ANY creature
 * you control that already carries a +1/+1 counter (the `withCounter` filter), then
 * doubles that creature's +1/+1 counters via [Effects.DoubleCounters] on the
 * triggering attacker ("it"). Doubling reads the post-declaration count, so multiple
 * counters from earlier doublings/anthems compound, and Branching Evolution-style
 * placement replacements still apply to the freshly placed counters (per ruling).
