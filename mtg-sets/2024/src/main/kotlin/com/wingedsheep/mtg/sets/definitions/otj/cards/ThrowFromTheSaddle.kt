/**
 * Throw from the Saddle
 * {1}{G}
 * Sorcery
 *
 * Target creature you control gets +1/+1 until end of turn. Put a +1/+1 counter on it instead
 * if it's a Mount. Then it deals damage equal to its power to target creature you don't control.
 *
 * The boost branches on the Mount test for target 0: a Mount gets a permanent +1/+1 counter,
 * otherwise a temporary +1/+1. The boost resolves first so the subsequent damage uses the
 * already-boosted power. Damage is sourced from target 0 (so it triggers "deals damage" effects on
 * that creature) and dealt to target 1.
