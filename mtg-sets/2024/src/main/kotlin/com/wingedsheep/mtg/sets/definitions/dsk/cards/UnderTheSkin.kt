/**
 * Under the Skin
 * {2}{G}
 * Sorcery
 * Manifest dread. (Look at the top two cards of your library. Put one onto the battlefield face
 * down as a 2/2 creature and the other into your graveyard. Turn it face up any time for its mana
 * cost if it's a creature card.)
 * You may return a permanent card from your graveyard to your hand.
 *
 * Resolves in order: first the shared [Patterns.Library.manifestDread] recipe (CR 701.62 — note the
 * card milled by manifest dread is itself an eligible return target if it's a permanent card), then
 * an optional return of a permanent card from your graveyard to your hand. The "you may return" is a
 * resolution-time selection (not a target): Gather every permanent card in your graveyard →
 * [SelectionMode.ChooseUpTo] 1 (optional) → move it to hand. Same Gather/Select/Move shape as
 * Overlord of the Balemurk's optional graveyard return.
