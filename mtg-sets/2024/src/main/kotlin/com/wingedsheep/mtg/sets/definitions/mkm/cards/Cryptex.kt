/**
 * Cryptex — Murders at Karlov Manor #251
 * {2} · Artifact · Rare
 *
 * {T}, Collect evidence 3: Add one mana of any color. Put an unlock counter on this artifact.
 * Sacrifice this artifact: Surveil 3, then draw three cards. Activate only if this artifact has
 * five or more unlock counters on it.
 *
 * A five-turn clock that pays rent the whole way: every tap is a Cabal Coffers-grade colour fixer
 * that also advances the combination, and the fifth one opens it for three cards.
 *
 * **The first ability really is a mana ability**, and the printed ruling says so: it doesn't use the
 * stack and can't be responded to. That is `manaAbility = true`, which also fixes the timing rule —
 * the rider (a counter) doesn't change the classification, because CR 605.1a asks only whether the
 * ability could add mana and whether it targets, not whether it does anything *else*. The counter
 * therefore lands at a moment nobody can interact with, exactly like the ICE painlands' damage
 * rider. Collect evidence sits in the cost alongside `{T}` as an ordinary cost atom, so CR 701.59b
 * applies: a graveyard that can't reach total mana value 3 makes the whole ability unactivatable
 * rather than offering a collection the player couldn't complete.
 *
 * **The unlock counter** is a new passive named counter ([CounterType.UNLOCK]) with no inherent rule of
 * its own — the same accumulate-then-threshold shape as `CounterType.POINT` and `CounterType.PLAN`, and
 * like them the payoff sacrifices its own source, so the "five or more" gate can never fire twice.
 * The gate is [ActivationRestriction.OnlyIfCondition] over
 * [Conditions.SourceCounterCountAtLeast], which reads the source's counters live rather than at
 * enters-time, so counters added by anything else (proliferate, a counter-doubler) count too.
 *
 * Note the second ability's cost is only the sacrifice — no mana, no tap. A Cryptex that is already
 * tapped, or summoning-sick, can still be cracked; the five taps it took to get there are the cost.
