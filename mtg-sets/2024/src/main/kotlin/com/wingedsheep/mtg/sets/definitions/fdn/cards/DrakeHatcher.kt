/**
 * Drake Hatcher
 * {1}{U}
 * Creature — Human Wizard
 * 1/3
 *
 * Vigilance, prowess (Whenever you cast a noncreature spell, this creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn.)
 * Whenever this creature deals combat damage to a player, put that many incubation counters on it.
 * Remove three incubation counters from this creature: Create a 2/2 blue Drake creature token with flying.
 *
 * "Incubation" counters here are a card-specific resource counter ([CounterType.INCUBATION]) — no
 * inherent rule; the combat-damage trigger accumulates them ("that many" = the damage just dealt,
 * read via [ContextPropertyKey.TRIGGER_DAMAGE_AMOUNT]) and the activated ability spends three to
 * hatch a Drake. NOT MTG's Incubate/incubator-token mechanic.
