/**
 * The Rollercrusher Ride — Duskmourn: House of Horror #155
 * {X}{2}{R} · Legendary Enchantment
 *
 * Delirium — If a source you control would deal noncombat damage to a permanent or player while
 * there are four or more card types among cards in your graveyard, it deals double that damage
 * instead.
 * When The Rollercrusher Ride enters, it deals X damage to each of up to X target creatures.
 *
 * **Delirium doubling** — a damage-amount replacement ([DoubleDamage], CR 616) gated on the new
 * `restrictions` list: it only doubles while [Conditions.Delirium] (four or more card types among
 * cards in your graveyard) holds, checked each time the source you control would deal *noncombat*
 * damage (`DamageType.NonCombat`) to any permanent or player. The source filter is
 * `GameObjectFilter.Any.youControl()` — "a source you control", not just creatures. The doubled
 * damage stays attributed to the original source (printed ruling 2024-09-20), which the engine's
 * amplification pass already does (it scales the amount in place without re-attributing).
 *
 * **ETB** — [DynamicAmount.CastX] reads the `{X}` paid to cast the enchantment and rides it onto
 * the permanent, so the enters trigger targets up to X creatures
 * (`TargetCreature.dynamicMaxCount = CastX`, snapshotted when the trigger goes on the stack) and
 * deals X to each via [ForEachTargetEffect] + [DealDamageEffect]. Leaving `damageSource` null
 * attributes the damage to the trigger's source (The Rollercrusher Ride), matching "it deals X
 * damage". X = 0 puts the trigger on the stack with no targets and deals nothing.
 *
 * The two abilities interact as printed: an X-damage ETB during delirium is itself noncombat
 * damage from a source you control, so each instance is doubled before being dealt.
