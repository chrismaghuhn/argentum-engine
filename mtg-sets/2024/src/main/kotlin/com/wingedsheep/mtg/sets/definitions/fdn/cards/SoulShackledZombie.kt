/**
 * Soul-Shackled Zombie
 * {3}{B}
 * Creature — Zombie
 * 4/2
 *
 * When this creature enters, exile up to two target cards from a single graveyard. If at least
 * one creature card was exiled this way, each opponent loses 2 life and you gain 2 life.
 *
 * "From a single graveyard" is the cross-target [TargetObject.sameOwner] constraint (Arashin
 * Sunshield shape). The chosen cards are gathered ([CardSource.ChosenTargets]) so the post-exile
 * "if at least one creature card was exiled this way" check is a [ConditionalOnCollectionEffect]
 * over the exiled pile filtered to creatures — gating the drain on what actually moved, not on
 * the (possibly-fizzled) targets.
