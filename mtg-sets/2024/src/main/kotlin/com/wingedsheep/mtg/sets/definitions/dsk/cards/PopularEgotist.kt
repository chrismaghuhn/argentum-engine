/**
 * Popular Egotist
 * {2}{B}
 * Creature — Human Rogue
 * 3/2
 *
 * {1}{B}, Sacrifice another creature or enchantment: This creature gains indestructible until end
 * of turn. Tap it.
 * Whenever you sacrifice a permanent, target opponent loses 1 life and you gain 1 life.
 *
 * The activated ability's cost is mana + sacrifice another creature or enchantment
 * ([Costs.SacrificeAnother] over [GameObjectFilter.CreatureOrEnchantment]). It grants this creature
 * indestructible until end of turn ([Duration.EndOfTurn]) and taps it.
 *
 * The sacrifice trigger (`Triggers.you.sacrifices(filter, batch = true)` over any permanent) is a batching trigger
 * that fires once per sacrifice event — including the activated ability's own sacrifice cost — and
 * drains a chosen opponent ([Targets.Opponent] loses 1 life, controller gains 1 life).
