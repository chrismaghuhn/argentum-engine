/**
 * Break Down the Door
 * {2}{G}
 * Instant
 * Choose one —
 * • Exile target artifact.
 * • Exile target enchantment.
 * • Manifest dread. (Look at the top two cards of your library. Put one onto the battlefield
 *   face down as a 2/2 creature and the other into your graveyard. Turn it face up any time
 *   for its mana cost if it's a creature card.)
 *
 * "Choose one" modal spell, same shape as [TwistReality]. The two exile modes target an artifact
 * or enchantment respectively (each a `target` slot resolved with [EffectTarget.ContextTarget]),
 * and the third mode reuses the shared [Patterns.Library.manifestDread] recipe (CR 701.62).
