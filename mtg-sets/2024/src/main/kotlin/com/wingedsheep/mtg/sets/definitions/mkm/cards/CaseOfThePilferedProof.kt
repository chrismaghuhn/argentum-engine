/**
 * Case of the Pilfered Proof — Murders at Karlov Manor #9
 * {1}{W} · Enchantment — Case · Uncommon
 *
 * Whenever a Detective you control enters or is turned face up, put a +1/+1 counter on it.
 * To solve — You control three or more Detectives.
 * Solved — If one or more tokens would be created under your control, those tokens plus a Clue
 * token are created instead.
 *
 * The first line is two triggers, not one, and they differ in more than wording — the same split
 * Perimeter Enforcer needs. The "enters" half is an ordinary
 * `Triggers.a(filter).enters()` with a Detective-you-control filter; the "turned face up" half is
 * `Triggers.<player>.permanentTurnedFaceUp(filter)`, whose filter reads the permanent's *post-flip* characteristics,
 * because a face-down creature is a nameless 2/2 and would never be a Detective at the moment it
 * flips. Both put the counter on `TriggeringEntity` — "on **it**", the creature that arrived or
 * flipped, not on the Case.
 *
 * The Solved line is a static ability in replacement-effect form (CR 702.169b), so its solved gate
 * rides in the replacement's own `restrictions` rather than through `solvedStaticAbility { }`:
 * replacement effects are declared outside the static-ability builder. `CreateAdditionalToken`
 * already models "those tokens plus an additional X instead" — one extra Clue per qualifying
 * creation event however many tokens that event made, which is exactly the printed reading.
 * `inheritTapped` stays false: the printed text has no tapped rider to inherit.
