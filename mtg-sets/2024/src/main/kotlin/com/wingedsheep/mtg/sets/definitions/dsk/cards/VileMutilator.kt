/**
 * Vile Mutilator
 * {5}{B}{B}
 * Creature — Demon
 * 6/5
 * As an additional cost to cast this spell, sacrifice a creature or enchantment.
 * Flying, trample
 * When this creature enters, each opponent sacrifices a nontoken enchantment of their choice, then
 * sacrifices a nontoken creature of their choice.
 *
 * Modeled entirely from existing primitives:
 *
 * - The additional cost is the standard [Costs.additional.SacrificePermanent] over
 *   [GameObjectFilter.CreatureOrEnchantment] (same shape as Final Vengeance / Embrace Oblivion).
 * - Flying and trample are plain keywords.
 * - The ETB is a `Triggers.self.enters()` whose effect is a two-step [Effects.Composite] in the
 *   printed order: first each opponent sacrifices a nontoken enchantment, *then* each opponent
 *   sacrifices a nontoken creature. Each step is an [Effects.Sacrifice] over the matching
 *   `.nontoken()` filter targeting [Player.EachOpponent]; because the sacrifice is forced onto a
 *   player (not a chosen target), that player picks which permanent to sacrifice — exactly the
 *   "of their choice" semantics. Token permanents are excluded by the `.nontoken()` filter, and the
 *   ordering of the two `Sacrifice` effects within the composite preserves "enchantment, then
 *   creature".
