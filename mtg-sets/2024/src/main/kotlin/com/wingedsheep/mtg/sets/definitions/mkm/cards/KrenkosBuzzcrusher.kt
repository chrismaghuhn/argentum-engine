/**
 * Krenko's Buzzcrusher — Murders at Karlov Manor #136
 * {2}{R}{R} · Artifact Creature — Insect Thopter · Rare
 * 4/4
 *
 * The lands are deliberately selected during resolution rather than declared as targets. One
 * [Effects.ForEachPlayer] iteration rebinds `Player.You` to that player while preserving
 * [Chooser.SourceController] for the Buzzcrusher controller's choice. [moveTracked] distinguishes
 * a land actually destroyed from an indestructible one, so only a successful destruction offers
 * that land's controller the compensating basic-land search.
