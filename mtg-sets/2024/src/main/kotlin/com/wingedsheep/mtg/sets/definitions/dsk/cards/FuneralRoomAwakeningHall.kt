/**
 * Funeral Room // Awakening Hall (DSK 100) — split-layout Room (CR 709.5).
 *
 * Funeral Room {2}{B} — Enchantment — Room
 *   Whenever a creature you control dies, each opponent loses 1 life and you gain 1 life.
 *
 * Awakening Hall {6}{B}{B} — Enchantment — Room
 *   When you unlock this door, return all creature cards from your graveyard to the battlefield.
 *
 * Cast each half separately; the cast face enters unlocked, the other locked. Pay the locked face's
 * printed mana cost as a sorcery-speed special action to unlock it (CR 709.5e).
 *
 * Funeral Room is a `Triggers.a(GameObjectFilter.Creature.youControl()).dies()` drain — `LoseLife(1, EachOpponent)` +
 * `GainLife(1)`, the canonical "each opponent loses 1 life and you gain 1 life" composite (cf.
 * Acolyte of Aclazotz). Awakening Hall is a "when you unlock this door" trigger
 * (`Triggers.self.doorUnlocked()`, CR 709.5h) whose mass reanimation gathers every creature card in
 * *your* graveyard and returns them under your control — the Twilight's Call
 * `GatherCards → MoveCollection` pipeline scoped to [Player.You].
