/**
 * Fuss // Bother — Murders at Karlov Manor #248
 * Split-layout spell (CR 709). Cast either half from hand; only the chosen half goes on the stack.
 *
 * Fuss {2}{R/W} — Instant
 *   Put a +1/+1 counter on each attacking creature you control.
 *
 * Bother {4}{W/U}{W/U} — Sorcery
 *   Create three 1/1 colorless Thopter artifact creature tokens with flying. Surveil 2.
 *
 * Neither half targets, so Fuss is [Effects.ForEachInGroup] over the attacking creatures you
 * control rather than a target list — it hits whatever is attacking as it resolves, and does
 * nothing at all outside combat. `EffectTarget.IterationEntity` inside the group body is the *iterated*
 * permanent, not the spell.
 *
 * Bother's Thopters take their art from the MKM `tokenArt` layer, so no `imageUri` is baked in.
 * Surveil comes last, matching printed order — the tokens exist before the surveil's graveyard
 * decision, which matters for anything watching token creation.
