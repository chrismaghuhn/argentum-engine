/**
 * Behind the Mask — Murders at Karlov Manor #39
 *
 * The optional collect-evidence cast cost stamps the shared evidence choice, which selects the
 * alternate 1/1 base stats at resolution. [Effects.BecomeCreature] adds both CREATURE and ARTIFACT
 * while retaining the target's other types, and its Layer-7b base-stat change composes correctly
 * with counters and later power/toughness modifiers.
