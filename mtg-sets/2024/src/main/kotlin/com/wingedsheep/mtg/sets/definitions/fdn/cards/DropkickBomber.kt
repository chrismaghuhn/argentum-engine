/**
 * Dropkick Bomber
 * {2}{R}
 * Creature — Goblin Warrior
 * 2/3
 *
 * Other Goblins you control get +1/+1.
 * {R}: Until end of turn, another target Goblin you control gains flying and "When this
 * creature deals combat damage, sacrifice it."
 *
 * The anthem is a [ModifyStats] static over other Goblins you control (excludeSelf). The
 * activated ability grants two things to another target Goblin until end of turn: flying
 * ([Effects.GrantKeyword]) and a granted triggered ability ([GrantTriggeredAbilityEffect])
 * whose SELF-bound combat-damage trigger (to any recipient — player or creature) sacrifices
 * the creature it was granted to ([SacrificeSelfEffect] resolves against the trigger's own
 * source). "Another target" excludes Dropkick Bomber itself via [TargetFilter.excludeSelf].
