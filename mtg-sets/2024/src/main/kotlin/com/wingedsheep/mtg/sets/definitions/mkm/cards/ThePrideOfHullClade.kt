/**
 * The Pride of Hull Clade — Murders at Karlov Manor #172
 * {10}{G} · Legendary Creature — Crocodile Elk Turtle · 2/15
 *
 * This spell costs {X} less to cast, where X is the total toughness of creatures you control.
 * Defender
 * {2}{U}{U}: Until end of turn, target creature you control gets +1/+0, gains "Whenever this
 * creature deals combat damage to a player, draw cards equal to its toughness," and can attack as
 * though it didn't have defender.
 *
 * The cost reduction is the toughness reading of Ghalta's power reduction —
 * [CostReductionSource.TotalPropertyAmongPermanentsYouControl] is the `(property, filter)`
 * generalization of `TotalPowerYouControl`, so this is `Toughness` over creatures you control
 * rather than a bespoke source. Both read *projected* toughness, so counters and anthems count,
 * and only generic mana is reduced (CR 601.2f) — which is what the ruling "can't reduce the total
 * cost below {G}" means in practice.
 *
 * The activated ability is three separate grants onto one target, not one bundled effect: a pump,
 * a granted quoted trigger, and a defender bypass. Inside the granted ability "this creature" is
 * the *host*, not The Pride — `Triggers.self.dealsCombatDamage(Recipient.AnyPlayer)` is SELF-bound and
 * [DynamicAmounts.sourceToughness] reads the ability's source, so both re-point at whatever
 * creature received the grant. That is what makes the card's own 15 toughness a payload you can
 * hand to something with evasion.
 *
 * The bypass is [Effects.CanAttackDespiteDefenderThisTurn] on the *target*, not on The Pride
 * itself — a 2/15 with defender is meant to hand the attack off, though targeting itself is legal
 * and is the obvious line when nothing better is on board.
