/**
 * Forensic Gadgeteer — Murders at Karlov Manor #57
 * {2}{U} · Creature — Vedalken Artificer Detective · 2/3
 *
 * Whenever you cast an artifact spell, investigate.
 * Activated abilities of artifacts you control cost {1} less to activate. This effect can't reduce
 * the mana in that cost to less than one mana.
 *
 * Both halves are existing vocabulary. The trigger is `youCastSpell` filtered to artifact spells —
 * the *spell* filter, not a battlefield one, so an artifact creature spell counts too (its type line
 * on the stack is still Artifact Creature).
 *
 * The static is [ReduceActivatedAbilityCost] with `manaFloor = 1`, which is the whole second
 * sentence: the reduction only eats generic mana and stops once one mana is left, so a Clue's
 * `{2}, Sacrifice this token` becomes `{1}` and never free. Two rulings shape what the filter must
 * *not* say. It's `GameObjectFilter.Artifact.youControl()` scoped to the battlefield group, because
 * the ability reaches only artifacts you control in play — cycling and other abilities that
 * function from hand or graveyard are untouched. And triggered abilities aren't activated
 * abilities, so nothing here needs to exclude them; `ReduceActivatedAbilityCost` only ever sees the
 * activated rail.
