/**
 * Metamorphic Blast {U}
 * Instant
 *
 * Spree (Choose one or more additional costs.)
 * + {1} — Until end of turn, target creature becomes a white Rabbit with base power and toughness 0/1.
 * + {3} — Target player draws two cards.
 *
 * Spree (CR 702.166) is modeled as a [ModalEffect] with `minChooseCount = 1`,
 * `chooseCount = modes.size`, and per-mode `additionalManaCost`. At least one mode
 * must be chosen; the same mode can't be chosen more than once (`allowRepeat`
 * stays at its default `false`). Each chosen mode targets independently.
 *
 * Mode 1 uses [Effects.BecomeCreature] to set the target's base power/toughness to
 * 0/1 (Layer 7b SET_VALUES), its creature type to Rabbit (Layer 4), and its color
 * to white (Layer 5), all until end of turn. It also overrides the rendered card art
 * (display-only `imageUri`) with the OTJ Rabbit token so the animated creature reads as a
 * Rabbit; the override reverts at end of turn with the rest of the animate. The token art
 * isn't on Scryfall (Metamorphic Blast animates rather than creating a token), so it's served
 * locally from the client's `public/images/tokens/` like the Invasion Saproling/Reflection art.
