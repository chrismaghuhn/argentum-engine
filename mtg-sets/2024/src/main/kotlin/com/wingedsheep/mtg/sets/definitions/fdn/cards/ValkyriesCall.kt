/**
 * Valkyrie's Call
 * {3}{W}{W}
 * Enchantment
 *
 * Whenever a nontoken, non-Angel creature you control dies, return that card to the
 * battlefield under its owner's control with a +1/+1 counter on it. It has flying and
 * is an Angel in addition to its other types.
 *
 * Modeled on the Vraska, the Silencer template: a filtered leaves-the-battlefield trigger
 * (`Triggers.<subject>.leaves(to, excludeTo, excludeSacrifice)` to [Zone.GRAVEYARD], ANY binding) whose filter restricts to
 * nontoken, non-Angel creatures the controller controls. [EffectTarget.TriggeringEntity] is
 * the dying card, now in the graveyard; [Effects.Move] returns it to the battlefield (under
 * its owner's control — the reanimation default), then a +1/+1 counter and two
 * [Duration.Permanent] continuous grants (Angel creature type + flying) apply to that
 * returned object for as long as it remains on the battlefield (CR 611.2b — the effect has
 * no duration and modifies the object created by the resolution).
