/**
 * Case of the Ransacked Lab — Murders at Karlov Manor #45
 * {2}{U} · Enchantment — Case · Rare
 *
 * Instant and sorcery spells you cast cost {1} less to cast.
 * To solve — You've cast four or more instant and sorcery spells this turn.
 * Solved — Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell, draw a card.
 *
 * The one Case whose *first* line is a static ability rather than an enters trigger, and the two
 * halves are deliberately the same spell type: the discount is what funds the four casts, and the
 * discount keeps working after the Case is solved — solving a Case never turns its other abilities
 * off.
 *
 * `ReduceGeneric(1)` rather than a blanket reduction, per the standard cost-reduction rulings: the
 * discount only shaves generic mana, so a `{U}{U}` spell is unaffected. The "to solve" count is
 * `YouCastSpellsThisTurn`, which reads the cast history — a spell that was countered, fizzled, or
 * is still on the stack all count, exactly as "you've cast" means.
