/**
 * Ugin's Labyrinth — Modern Horizons 3 #233
 * Land · Mythic
 *
 * Imprint — When this land enters, you may exile a colorless card with mana value 7 or greater
 * from your hand.
 * {T}: Add {C}. If a card is exiled with this land, add {C}{C} instead.
 * {T}: Return the exiled card to its owner's hand.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *  - "Imprint" (CR 207.2c) is an ability word here, not a rules keyword — it just labels the ETB
 *    exile-and-link ability, same as the SDK's other linked-exile cards (Clive's Hideaway).
 *  - The ETB gathers hand cards already filtered to colorless + mana value 7 or greater, then
 *    offers an optional (`ChooseUpTo(1)`) pick — modelling "you may exile a [filter] card" as a
 *    gather-then-optional-select rather than a mandatory `EntersWithChoice`, since declining is
 *    legal and leaves the hand untouched. The picked card is exiled linked to this land
 *    ([MoveCollectionEffect.linkToSource]).
 *  - The mana ability reads back [ContextPropertyKey.LINKED_EXILE_CARD_COUNT] (0 normally, 1 once
 *    a card is imprinted) via `1 + min(count, 1)`, so it's {C} until something is exiled and {C}{C}
 *    from then on — exactly "If a card is exiled with this land, add {C}{C} instead," and it stays
 *    that way even after a subsequent activation of the third ability (Ugin's Labyrinth has no way
 *    to un-link the card short of the third ability actually returning it).
 *  - The third ability is [Patterns.Exile.returnLinkedExileToHand] — a no-op if nothing is linked
 *    (legal to activate, per the 2024-06-07 ruling it returns *every* linked card if more than one
 *    was ever exiled, e.g. via a copied trigger).
