/**
 * Case of the Shattered Pact — Murders at Karlov Manor #1
 * {2} · Enchantment — Case · Uncommon
 *
 * When this Case enters, search your library for a basic land card, reveal it, put it into your
 * hand, then shuffle.
 * To solve — There are five colors among permanents you control.
 * Solved — At the beginning of combat on your turn, target creature you control gains flying,
 * double strike, and vigilance until end of turn.
 *
 * The colorless Case, and the only one whose "to solve" clause is a five-colour board check rather
 * than a per-turn tracker. That check is [DynamicAmounts.colorsAmongPermanents] compared against
 * `Fixed(5)` — the same aggregate Coalition Victory uses, so the ruling that a single multicoloured
 * permanent counts toward *every* colour it has falls out for free, and so does the corollary that
 * colorless permanents (including this Case) never contribute. The filter is `Permanent`, not
 * `Creature`: lands, artifacts, and the Case's own five-colour enablers all count.
 *
 * The ETB search is mandatory — no `optional = true`. A player with no basic land left still
 * searches and shuffles; the reveal is what makes an empty-handed search public.
