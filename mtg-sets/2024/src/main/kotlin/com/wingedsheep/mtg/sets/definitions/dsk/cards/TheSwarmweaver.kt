/**
 * The Swarmweaver
 * {2}{B}{G}
 * Legendary Artifact Creature — Scarecrow
 * 2/3
 *
 * When The Swarmweaver enters, create two 1/1 black and green Insect creature tokens with flying.
 * Delirium — As long as there are four or more card types among cards in your graveyard, Insects
 * and Spiders you control get +1/+1 and have deathtouch.
 *
 * The ETB makes two 1/1 black-green flying Insect tokens (DSK Insect token). Delirium is an ability
 * word with no rules meaning; the conditional lord is two static abilities over `Insects and Spiders
 * you control` ([GameObjectFilter.Creature].withAnyOfSubtypes(Insect, Spider).youControl()), each
 * gated by [Conditions.Delirium] (four+ distinct card types in your graveyard): a +1/+1 [ModifyStats]
 * (layer 7c) and a deathtouch [GrantKeyword] (layer 6). The filter carries no `excludeSelf` because
 * the printed text says "Insects and Spiders you control", not "other" — and The Swarmweaver is a
 * Scarecrow, so it never matches the filter anyway.
