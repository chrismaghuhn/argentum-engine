/**
 * Tenth District Hero
 * {1}{W}
 * Creature — Human
 * 2/3
 *
 * {1}{W}, Collect evidence 2: This creature becomes a Human Detective with base power and
 * toughness 4/4 and gains vigilance.
 * {2}{W}, Collect evidence 4: If this creature is a Detective, it becomes a legendary creature
 * named Mileva, the Stalwart, it has base power and toughness 5/5, and it gains "Other creatures
 * you control have indestructible."
 *
 * Both abilities are **durationless** (`Duration.Permanent`) — per the card's rulings the effects
 * last until the game ends, the permanent leaves the battlefield, or a later effect overwrites
 * them. Neither is a transform: they are ordinary continuous effects stacked by timestamp, so
 * re-activating the first ability after the second re-sets base P/T to 4/4 while leaving the
 * name, supertype and granted static from the second in place (the second ruling's case).
 *
 * The second ability's "if this creature is a Detective" is a **resolution-time** check on the
 * source (third ruling: the ability may be activated regardless of type and simply does nothing
 * if the check fails), so it is a `Effects.If` inside the effect rather than an
 * `ActivationRestriction`. It reads projected state via `Conditions.SourceMatches`, so any route
 * to Detective-hood counts, not just the first ability (fourth ruling).
 *
 * "becomes a legendary creature" is the supertype, granted with `AddCardType("LEGENDARY")` —
 * the engine projects supertypes into the same type set, so there is no separate supertype effect.
 *
 * The rename and the granted static ride `BecomeArtifactEffect`, the SDK's general permanent
 * transform, with every artifact-flavoured knob turned off: `cardTypes = null` and the new
 * `subtypes = null` keep the Hero exactly the Human Detective it already is, and
 * `loseAllAbilities = false` keeps its own two activated abilities. That effect is the only route
 * to a *projected* rename (Layer 3) and a *projected* static grant — `Effects.GrantStaticAbility`
 * writes to the point-of-use `grantedStaticAbilities` store instead, which the layer projector
 * never reads, so a `SetName` or `GrantKeyword` handed over that way is silently inert. Its
 * grants also last exactly as long as the permanent stays on the battlefield, which is the
 * durationless lifetime this ability wants.
