/**
 * Vannifar, Evolved Enigma — Murders at Karlov Manor #241
 * {2}{G}{U} · Legendary Creature — Elf Ooze Wizard · 3/4
 *
 * At the beginning of combat on your turn, choose one —
 * • Cloak a card from your hand.
 * • Put a +1/+1 counter on each colorless creature you control.
 *
 * The two modes are one engine: cloaking makes colorless 2/2s, and the counter mode grows exactly
 * those. Nothing links them in the SDK — the link is that a face-down permanent is colorless
 * (CR 708.2), and [CardPredicate.IsColorless] reads *projected* colors, so a cloaked card counts
 * regardless of what it is on the front.
 *
 * The cloak mode is the hand-side twin of Hide in Plain Sight's library pipeline: gather the hand,
 * select one, and move it to the battlefield with [FaceDownMode.CLOAK]. There is no
 * cloak-from-hand facade because this is the first card that needs one — `Patterns.Hand.putFromHand`
 * has no face-down mode, and widening it for a single caller would be speculative. An empty hand
 * simply selects nothing and the mode does nothing; the mode is still legal to choose (CR 601.2b
 * — modes aren't checked for effect).
 *
 * The counter mode is `ForEachInGroup` rather than a targeted effect: "each colorless creature you
 * control" targets nothing, so it reaches hexproof creatures and can't be fizzled.
