 * Goblin Maskmaker — Murders at Karlov Manor #130

 *
 * The discount is created when the attack trigger resolves and lives on the controller for the
 * rest of the turn, so it survives the Maskmaker leaving the battlefield. A face-down spell is
 * identified by the same projected face-down predicate used for disguise and cloak permanents;
 * only generic mana can be reduced.
