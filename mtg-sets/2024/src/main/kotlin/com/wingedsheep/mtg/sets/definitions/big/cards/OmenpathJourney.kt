/**
 * Omenpath Journey — {3}{G} Enchantment (The Big Score, mythic).
 *
 * "When this enchantment enters, search your library for up to five land cards that have
 *  different names, exile them, then shuffle.
 *  At the beginning of your end step, choose a card at random exiled with this enchantment
 *  and put it onto the battlefield tapped."
 *
 * Implemented as an atomic pipeline:
 *  - ETB: Gather library lands → ChooseUpTo(5) with OnePerCardName (different names) →
 *    MoveCollection to exile linked to this source → shuffle.
 *  - Your end step: Gather from this source's linked exile → Random(1) → MoveCollection
 *    onto the battlefield tapped.
 *
 * Rulings:
 *  - You may search for fewer than five land cards (or none) — "up to five".
 *  - While in your library, a double-faced card has only its front-face name, so you can't
 *    reveal two of the same DFC this way.
