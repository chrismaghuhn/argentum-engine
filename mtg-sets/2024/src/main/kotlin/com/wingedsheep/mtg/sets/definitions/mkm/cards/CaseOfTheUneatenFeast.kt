/**
 * Case of the Uneaten Feast — Murders at Karlov Manor #10
 * {W} · Enchantment — Case · Rare
 *
 * Whenever a creature you control enters, you gain 1 life.
 * To solve — You've gained 5 or more life this turn.
 * Solved — Sacrifice this Case: Creature cards in your graveyard gain "You may cast this card
 * from your graveyard" until end of turn.
 *
 * "You've gained 5 or more life this turn" is the amount, not the number of gain events, so it is
 * `TurnTracking(You, LIFE_GAINED)` — five separate creatures each gaining 1 solves it, and so does
 * one Lightning Helix. Life *lost* never nets against it.
 *
 * The Solved ability is the interesting half. The printed text grants the permission to *cards*,
 * so the affected set is locked in when the ability resolves (CR 611.2c): a creature card put into
 * the graveyard later that turn is not covered. That rules out modelling it as a standing
 * player-wide "you may cast creature cards from your graveyard this turn" permission anchored to a
 * permanent — which would also have nowhere to anchor, since the Case sacrifices itself as the
 * cost and is gone by the time the ability resolves. So the ability gathers the creature cards in
 * the graveyard and hands each of them its own `MayCastFromGraveyard` grant for the turn; the
 * graveyard-cast enumerator and `CastZoneResolver` read a grant anchored to a graveyard card as
 * that one card's permission.
 *
 * Sacrificing is a cost, so it happens on activation and the ability resolves with the Case
 * already in the graveyard — where, being a creature-less enchantment card, it grants itself
 * nothing.
