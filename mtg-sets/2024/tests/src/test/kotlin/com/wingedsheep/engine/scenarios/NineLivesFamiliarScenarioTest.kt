/**
 * Nine-Lives Familiar (FDN #66) — {1}{B}{B} 1/1 Creature — Cat.
 *
 * "This creature enters with eight revival counters on it if you cast it.
 *  When this creature dies, if it had a revival counter on it, return it to the battlefield with
 *  one fewer revival counter on it at the beginning of the next end step."
 *
 * Covers the cast-gated enters-with-counters replacement, the last-known-counter intervening "if"
 * on the dies trigger, and the delayed end-step return with the decremented count.
