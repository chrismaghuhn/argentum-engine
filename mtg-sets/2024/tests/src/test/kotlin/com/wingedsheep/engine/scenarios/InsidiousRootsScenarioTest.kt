/**
 * Insidious Roots (MKM #208) — {B}{G} enchantment.
 *
 * "Creature tokens you control have '{T}: Add one mana of any color.'"
 * "Whenever one or more creature cards leave your graveyard, create a 0/1 green Plant creature
 *  token, then put a +1/+1 counter on each Plant you control."
 *
 * Two things worth pinning down:
 *
 *  - the payoff is **ordered**, not simultaneous. The token is created first and the counters land
 *    second, so the brand-new Plant gets one too and arrives as a 1/2. An implementation that
 *    snapshots the group before creating the token leaves it a 0/1.
 *  - the counters go on **Plants**, not on all creature tokens — a Detective token sitting next to
 *    them must stay untouched, which a filter copied from the first ability would get wrong.
 *
 * The second trigger fires exactly once per batch (CR 603.2c) by construction — that is
 * `Triggers.oneOrMore(filter).leaveYourGraveyard()`, shared with Chalk Outline and covered by its test — so this
 * file drives it once and spends its assertions on the payoff instead.
