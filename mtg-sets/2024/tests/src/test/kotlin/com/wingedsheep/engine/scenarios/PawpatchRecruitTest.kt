/**
 * "Whenever a creature you control becomes the target of a spell or ability
 * an opponent controls, put a +1/+1 counter on target creature you control
 * other than that creature."
 *
 * "That creature" = the creature that was targeted by the opponent (the triggering
 * entity), NOT the Pawpatch Recruit that owns the ability. If an opponent targets
 * one of your creatures, you must put the counter on a *different* creature you
 * control — including Pawpatch Recruit itself if it wasn't the one that was
 * targeted.
