/**
 * Cryptic Coat (MKM #50) — {2}{U} Artifact — Equipment.
 *
 * "When this Equipment enters, cloak the top card of your library, then attach this Equipment to
 * it. Equipped creature gets +1/+0 and can't be blocked. {1}{U}: Return this Equipment to its
 * owner's hand."
 *
 * The whole card hangs on the "then": the Equipment must land on the very permanent its own
 * trigger just created, with no targeting. That is a two-step pipeline handoff —
 * `MoveCollectionEffect.storeMovedAs` republishes the *battlefield* entity id after the face-down
 * move, and `EffectTarget.PipelineTarget` feeds it to the attach. If that handoff silently
 * resolved to nothing, the card would still cloak and would still look correct on the board, so
 * the attachment assertion is the point of this file, not decoration.
 *
 * Cryptic Coat has no equip ability by design (Scryfall ruling 2024-02-02), so the bounce test
 * doubles as the "re-cloak" loop check: return it, recast it, and a second card is cloaked.
