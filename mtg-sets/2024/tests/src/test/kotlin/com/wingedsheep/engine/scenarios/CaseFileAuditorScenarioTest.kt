/**
 * Case File Auditor — "When this creature enters **and whenever you solve a Case**, look at the top
 * six cards of your library. You may reveal an enchantment card from among them and put it into
 * your hand. Put the rest on the bottom of your library in a random order."
 *
 * The new vocabulary is `Triggers.you.solvesACase()`, so the load-bearing assertions are:
 *
 *  1. solving a Case fires it — and fires it for the *solving* player, which is what the event's
 *     carried controller is for;
 *  2. it does **not** fire on the Case merely entering, nor on an opponent's Case being solved;
 *  3. the two printed conditions are two abilities, so an Auditor that entered earlier still sees a
 *     later solve.
 *
 * The look itself is the "up to one" shape: the pick is filtered to enchantments and declinable, so
 * a library of six non-enchantments must resolve with no prompt-forced pick and an unchanged hand.
