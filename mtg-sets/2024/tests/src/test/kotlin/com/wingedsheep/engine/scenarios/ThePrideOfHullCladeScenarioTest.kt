/**
 * The Pride of Hull Clade (MKM #172) — {10}{G} 2/15 Legendary Creature — Crocodile Elk Turtle.
 *
 * "This spell costs {X} less to cast, where X is the total toughness of creatures you control.
 *  Defender
 *  {2}{U}{U}: Until end of turn, target creature you control gets +1/+0, gains 'Whenever this
 *  creature deals combat damage to a player, draw cards equal to its toughness,' and can attack as
 *  though it didn't have defender."
 *
 * Two things are worth pinning down. The cost reduction is the *toughness* reading of Ghalta's
 * power reduction, so it is asserted against creatures whose power and toughness differ — a
 * power-vs-toughness mix-up would pass any test built on vanilla bears. And the ruling that the
 * reduction "can't reduce the total cost below {G}" falls out of CR 601.2f (only generic mana is
 * reduced), which is checked with a board big enough to overshoot the {10}.
 *
 * The activated ability's three grants land on the *target*, not on the Pride: inside the granted
 * trigger "this creature" re-points at whatever received it, which is the whole reason the card
 * hands its ability to something with evasion rather than attacking with a defender-bearing 2/15.
