/**
 * Victor, Valgavoth's Seneschal (DSK) — the escalating Eerie ability.
 *
 * "Eerie — Whenever an enchantment you control enters and whenever you fully unlock a Room, surveil 2
 * if this is the first time this ability has resolved this turn. If it's the second time, each
 * opponent discards a card. If it's the third time, put a creature card from a graveyard onto the
 * battlefield under your control."
 *
 * Drives the enchantment-enters half three times in one turn (casting three Test Enchantments) and
 * verifies the per-turn resolution counter escalates the payoff: 1st = surveil, 2nd = opponent
 * discards, 3rd = reanimate from any graveyard under your control. The counter lives on the source
 * permanent, so both Eerie triggers would share it (only the enchantment half is exercised here).
