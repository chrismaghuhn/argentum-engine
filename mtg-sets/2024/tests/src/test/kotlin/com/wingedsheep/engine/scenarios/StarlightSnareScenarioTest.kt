/**
 * Starlight Snare (FDN #514) — {2}{U} Enchantment — Aura.
 *
 * "Enchant creature
 *  When this Aura enters, tap enchanted creature.
 *  Enchanted creature doesn't untap during its controller's untap step."
 *
 * Pins both halves: the ETB trigger taps the enchanted creature, and the
 * `DOESNT_UNTAP` grant keeps it tapped through its controller's next untap step —
 * including when the Aura is cast on an *opponent's* creature, which is the way the
 * card is actually played.
