 * Ghostly Keybearer ({3}{U} 3/3 Spirit, flying): "Whenever this creature deals combat damage to a
 * player, unlock a locked door of up to one target Room you control."
 *
 * Exercises the resolution-time "unlock a door" effect (CR 709.5f) and its "up to one target Room
 * you control with a locked door" targeting:
 *  - a locked Room is a legal target and its door is unlocked, firing the face's
 *    "When you unlock this door" trigger (CR 709.5h);
 *  - with no Room to unlock, the optional trigger resolves harmlessly (up-to-one);
 *  - a fully-unlocked Room is not a legal target (the locked-door restriction).
