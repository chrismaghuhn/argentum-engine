/**
 * Regression test: a triggered ability that targets a creature must emit a
 * BecomesTargetEvent that feeds trigger detection, so the targeted creature's
 * Valiant trigger fires.
 *
 * Setup: P1 controls Manifold Mouse and Nettle Guard. At beginning of combat,
 * Manifold Mouse's trigger targets Nettle Guard. Because Nettle Guard becomes
 * the target of an ability P1 controls for the first time this turn, its
 * Valiant ability should fire and grant +0/+2 until end of turn.
