/**
 * Scathing Shadelock // Venomous Words — Secrets of Strixhaven #98
 * {4}{B} · Creature — Snake Warlock · 4/6
 *
 * At the beginning of your first main phase, this creature becomes prepared.
 * (While it's prepared, you may cast a copy of its spell. Doing so unprepares it.)
 * //
 * Venomous Words — {B} · Sorcery: Target creature you control gets +2/+0 and gains
 * deathtouch until end of turn.
 *
 * Prepare (Secrets of Strixhaven): Scathing Shadelock does NOT enter prepared (no PREPARED
 * keyword). It becomes prepared via its first-main-phase trigger through [Effects.BecomePrepared].
 * Becoming prepared creates a copy of its prepare spell ("Venomous Words") in exile that its
 * controller may cast for {B}; casting that copy unprepares the creature. Modeled via
 * `CardLayout.PREPARE` + the `prepare(name) { }` DSL, like Maelstrom Artisan / Leech Collector.
