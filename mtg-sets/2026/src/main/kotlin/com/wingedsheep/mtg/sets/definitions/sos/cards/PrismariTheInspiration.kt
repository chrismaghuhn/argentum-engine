/**

 * Legendary Creature — Elder Dragon
 * 7/7

 * Flying
 * Ward—Pay 5 life.
 * Instant and sorcery spells you cast have storm.
 *
 * The storm grant is a continuous static ability ([GrantKeywordToOwnSpells]) scoped to the
 * controller — while Prismari is on the battlefield, instant and sorcery spells its controller
 * casts effectively have storm (CR 702.40). The cast handler reads battlefield
 * `GrantKeywordToOwnSpells` grants alongside printed storm when building each spell's storm
 * trigger, so removing Prismari before the spell is cast revokes the grant. Like the printed
 * keyword, the granted storm copies zero times when no other spells have been cast this turn.
