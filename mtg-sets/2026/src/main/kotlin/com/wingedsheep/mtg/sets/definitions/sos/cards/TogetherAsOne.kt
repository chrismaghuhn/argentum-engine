/**
 * Together as One
 * {6}
 * Sorcery
 *
 * Converge — Target player draws X cards, Together as One deals X damage to any target, and you gain
 * X life, where X is the number of colors of mana spent to cast this spell.
 *
 * A three-part Converge spell. X = [DynamicAmounts.colorsOfManaSpent]
 * (`DynamicAmount.DistinctColorsManaSpent`), resolved while the spell is still on the stack so it
 * reads the live per-colour payment buckets (same as Snarl Song / Arcane Omens). The two targets are
 * declared in printed order — *target player* first, *any target* second — and the three effects are
 * chained with `.then(...)`: the target player draws X, Together as One deals X to the any-target
 * (damage source = the spell itself), and the controller gains X life. With an all-colourless {6}
 * payment X = 0: the player draws nothing, no damage is dealt, and no life is gained — the spell
 * still resolves and its targets are still chosen at cast time.
