/**
 * Roads Go Ever, Ever On
 * {1}{W}
 * Enchantment — Saga
 *
 * I — Search your library for up to two basic Plains cards, exile them, then shuffle. You gain 2 life.
 * II, III — Put a card exiled with this Saga into its owner's hand.
 * IV — Whenever you attack this turn, target creature you control gets +1/+1 until end of turn for
 * each Plains you control.
 *
 * Chapter I links the selected cards to the Saga. Chapters II and III gather that live linked pile
 * and let the player choose one card rather than taking an arbitrary entry. Chapter IV installs an
 * event-based delayed trigger; its target and Plains count are chosen/evaluated when that trigger
 * fires, not when the chapter resolves.
