/**
 * Root Manipulation
 * {3}{B}{G}
 * Sorcery
 *
 * Until end of turn, creatures you control get +2/+2 and gain menace and "Whenever this
 * creature attacks, you gain 1 life."
 *
 * Like Overrun, this is a one-shot pump applied to each creature the controller has at
 * resolution (Rule 611.2c — the set of affected creatures is locked in when the spell
 * resolves; creatures entering later in the turn are unaffected). Each affected creature
 * receives +2/+2, the menace keyword, and a granted "Whenever this creature attacks, you
 * gain 1 life" triggered ability ([TriggerBinding.SELF] via `Triggers.self.attacks()`), all for
 * the duration of the turn.
