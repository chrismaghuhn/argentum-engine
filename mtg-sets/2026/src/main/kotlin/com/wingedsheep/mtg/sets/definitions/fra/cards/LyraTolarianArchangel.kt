/**
 * Lyra, Tolarian Archangel.
 *
 * The end-step trigger is an intervening "if" (Resplendent Angel's shape): it checks your
 * cards-drawn-this-turn tally both when the end step begins and on resolution, and it fires at
 * *each* end step, so drawing three on an opponent's turn makes an Angel at their end step too.
 *
 * The activated ability's "until end of turn, whenever Lyra deals combat damage to a player" is
 * recorded as a turn-long triggered ability on Lyra herself. It ends with the turn, is lost if
 * Lyra leaves the battlefield (a returned Lyra is a new object), and a second activation stacks
 * a second instance — two activations draw four.
