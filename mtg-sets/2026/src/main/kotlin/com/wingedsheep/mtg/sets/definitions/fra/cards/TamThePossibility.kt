/**
 * Tam, the Possibility — Reality Fracture #276
 * {1}{G}{U} · Legendary Creature — Gorgon Wizard · 2/4
 *
 * Planeswalker spells you cast cost {1} less to cast.
 * {W}{U}{B}{R}{G}, {T}: Proliferate X times, where X is the number of planeswalker types among
 * planeswalkers you control.
 *
 * X is [DynamicAmounts.planeswalkerTypes] — distinct planeswalker types (CR 205.3j), so two Jaces
 * count once — counted as the ability resolves. Each proliferate is its own choice of permanents
 * and players ([RepeatDynamicTimesEffect] over `Effects.Proliferate()`), made against the counters
 * the previous pass left.
