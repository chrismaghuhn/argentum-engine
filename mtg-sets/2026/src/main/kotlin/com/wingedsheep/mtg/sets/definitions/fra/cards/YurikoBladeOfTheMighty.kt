/**
 * Yuriko, Blade of the Mighty
 *
 * - "During combat" is the combat phase on anyone's turn (`IsInPhase(COMBAT, yoursOnly = false)`),
 *   and "players" is everyone, Yuriko's controller included.
 * - The cast half is [PlayersCantCastSpells]; the activate half is [PlayersCantActivateAbilities]
 *   with mana abilities exempt and `anyZone` set, since the printed text names no object — it also
 *   stops graveyard and hand abilities such as cycling, and crewing.
 * - "Attacks a player alone": the lone declared attacker ([AttackPredicate.Alone]) whose defender
 *   is a player (`attackingAnOpponent()` — a creature you control only ever attacks an opponent),
 *   so attacking a planeswalker or battle alone doesn't trigger it.
