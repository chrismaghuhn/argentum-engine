 * +1: Surveil 2.
 * −1: Any number of target players each discard a card.
 * −2: Return target creature card with mana value 3 or less from your graveyard to the battlefield.
 * −7: Flip five coins. Target opponent skips their next X turns, where X is the number of coins
 *     that came up heads.

 * The ultimate composes two general primitives: [Effects.FlipCoins] tallies the heads into the
 * pipeline, and [Effects.SkipNextTurn] reads that tally as its turn count — so a result of zero
 * heads is a clean no-op.
