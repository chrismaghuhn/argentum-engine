/**
 * Deluge Virtuoso
 * {2}{U}
 * Creature — Human Wizard
 * 2/2
 *
 * When this creature enters, tap target creature an opponent controls and put a stun counter on it.
 * (If a permanent with a stun counter would become untapped, remove one from it instead.)
 *
 * Opus — Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell, this creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn.
 * If five or more mana was spent to cast that spell, this creature gets +2/+2 until end of turn instead.
 *
 * The ETB taps + stun-counters a single chosen opponent creature (tap then add a "STUN" counter on the
 * same `ContextTarget(0)`). "Opus" is an ability word (flavor only); the `opus { }` builder wires the
 * spell-cast trigger and the 5+ mana tier. Here the 5+ mana bonus **replaces** the base pump
 * (`insteadIfFiveOrMore`): +1/+1 normally, +2/+2 when five or more mana was spent. `ModifyStats`
 * defaults to an until-end-of-turn buff.
