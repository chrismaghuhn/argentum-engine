/**
 * The granted −4 declares "target player" before "up to one target creature or planeswalker",
 * the reverse of the Oracle sentence. Cast-time target slots are positional, so an optional
 * target has to come last to be declinable. CR 601.2c fixes no order between separate targets,
 * and the effects bind by name, so the reversal changes nothing else.
