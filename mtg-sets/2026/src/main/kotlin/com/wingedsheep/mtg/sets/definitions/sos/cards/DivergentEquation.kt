 * X-clamped graveyard targeting (Restock + Distorting Wake patterns): [TargetObject.dynamicMaxCount]
 * = [DynamicAmount.XValue] makes the targeting overlay's max selection track the X chosen at cast
 * time, and `optional = true` lets "up to X" pick fewer (or zero) without fizzling. The chosen
 * instant/sorcery cards are returned to hand via [ForEachTargetEffect], then [selfExile] sends this
 * spell to exile instead of the graveyard on resolution.
