/**
 * Comforting Counsel
 * {1}{G}
 * Enchantment
 *
 * Whenever you gain life, put a growth counter on this enchantment.
 * As long as there are five or more growth counters on this enchantment, creatures you control
 * get +3/+3.
 *
 * Same shape as Beastmaster Ascension: a `Triggers.you.gainsLife()` trigger that drops a [CounterType.GROWTH]
 * counter on [EffectTarget.Self], plus a counter-gated anthem. The threshold gate is the generic
 * [Conditions.SourceCounterCountAtLeast] (≥5 growth counters), which reads the enchantment's counters
 * live, and the buff applies to all creatures you control via [GroupFilter.AllCreaturesYouControl].
