/**
 * Abigale, Poet Laureate // Heroic Stanza — Secrets of Strixhaven #170
 * {1}{W}{B} · Legendary Creature — Bird Bard · 2/3
 *
 * Flying
 * Whenever you cast a creature spell, Abigale becomes prepared.
 * (While it's prepared, you may cast a copy of its spell. Doing so unprepares it.)
 * //
 * Heroic Stanza — {1}{W/B}, Sorcery: Put a +1/+1 counter on target creature.
 *
 * Prepare (Secrets of Strixhaven): unlike "enters prepared" preparation creatures, Abigale does NOT
 * enter prepared (no PREPARED keyword). She becomes prepared only via her trigger — whenever you cast
 * a creature spell — through [Effects.BecomePrepared]. Becoming prepared creates a copy of her prepare
 * spell ("Heroic Stanza") in exile that her controller may cast for {1}{W/B}; casting that copy
 * unprepares her. A creature already prepared does not re-prepare, so the trigger is a no-op while she
 * is already prepared. Modeled via [CardLayout.PREPARE] + the `prepare(name) { }` DSL.
