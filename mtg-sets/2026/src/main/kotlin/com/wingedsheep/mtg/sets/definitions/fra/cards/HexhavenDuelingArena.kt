/**
 * Hexhaven Dueling Arena — Reality Fracture #181
 * Land
 *
 * Both prepare abilities may target any creature (the {2} one only a creature that attacked this
 * turn); only a creature with a prepare spell can actually become prepared, which
 * [Effects.BecomePrepared] enforces at resolution — any other creature is a legal target and the
 * ability simply does nothing to it.
