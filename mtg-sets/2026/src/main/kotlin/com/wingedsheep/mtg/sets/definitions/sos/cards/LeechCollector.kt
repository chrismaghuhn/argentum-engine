/**
 * Leech Collector // Bloodletting — Secrets of Strixhaven #88
 * {1}{B} · Creature — Human Warlock · 2/2
 *
 * Whenever you gain life for the first time each turn, this creature becomes prepared.
 * (While it's prepared, you may cast a copy of its spell. Doing so unprepares it.)
 * //
 * Bloodletting — {B}, Sorcery: Each opponent loses 2 life.
 *
 * Prepare (Secrets of Strixhaven): unlike "enters prepared" preparation creatures, Leech Collector
 * does NOT enter prepared (it has no PREPARED keyword). It only becomes prepared via its trigger —
 * the first time you gain life each turn — through [Effects.BecomePrepared]. Becoming prepared
 * creates a copy of its prepare spell ("Bloodletting") in exile that its controller may cast for
 * {B}; casting that copy unprepares the creature. Modeled via [CardLayout.PREPARE] + the
 * `prepare(name) { }` DSL.
