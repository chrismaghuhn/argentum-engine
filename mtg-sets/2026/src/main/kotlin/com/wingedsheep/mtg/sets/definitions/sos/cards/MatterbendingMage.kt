/**
 * Matterbending Mage
 * {2}{U}
 * Creature — Human Wizard
 * 2/2
 * When this creature enters, return up to one other target creature to its owner's hand.
 * Whenever you cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, this creature can't be blocked this turn.
 *
 * The ETB bounce is the standard "up to one other target creature" + `ReturnToHand` (see
 * Rimekin Recluse). The second ability triggers on casting a spell whose *printed cost* has `{X}`
 * (`SpellCastPredicate.HasXInCost`, see Geometer's Arthropod) — X=0 still counts — and grants
 * itself the `CANT_BE_BLOCKED` keyword for the turn via `Effects.GrantKeyword` (a floating keyword
 * grant the projection / blocker-evasion path reads, like Bria, Riptide Rogue — not a granted printed
 * static ability, which the keyword projection wouldn't pick up).
