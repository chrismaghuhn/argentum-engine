/**
 * Loki Laufeyson — Marvel Super Heroes #143 (uncommon)
 * {1}{R} · Legendary Creature — God Sorcerer Villain · 2/1
 *
 * {1}, {T}: When you next cast an instant or sorcery spell with mana value less than or equal to
 * Loki's power this turn, copy that spell. You may choose new targets for the copy.
 * Power-up — {4}{R}: Put two +1/+1 counters on Loki. (Activate each power-up ability only once.
 * Reduce the cost by his mana cost if he entered this turn.)
 *
 * Ability 1 is the standard pending-rider shape ([Effects.CopyNextSpellCast], Howl of the Horde /
 * Gadwick's First Duel), the only novelty being that the mana-value cap is not a constant but
 * Loki's own power — `manaValueAtMostDynamic(DynamicAmounts.sourcePower())`. The rider's filter is
 * evaluated when the spell is actually cast, which is exactly when the delayed trigger's condition
 * is checked, so pumping Loki with the power-up ability *after* activating this one still widens
 * what the rider will copy. (`CastSpellHandler` threads the rider's own `sourceId` into the
 * predicate context so `EntityReference.Source` resolves to Loki rather than to nothing.)
 *
 * Ability 2 is the plain power-up cycle shape (CR 702.193, Brave Brawler): `isPowerUp = true`
 * desugars to `ActivationRestriction.Once` and switches on the engine's pip-wise self cost
 * reduction, so on the turn Loki enters, {4}{R} − {1}{R} = {3}.
 *
 * The two abilities read as one card: activate the copy rider, then power up to a 4/3 and the
 * rider will now catch an instant or sorcery costing up to four.
 *
 * **Last-known information for the cap.** If Loki has left the battlefield by the time the matching
 * spell is cast (armed the rider, powered up to 4/3, then got killed in response), CR 608.2h makes
 * the cap his *last known* power — 4 — because the effect reads information from an object that is
 * no longer in the zone it was expected to be in (see also CR 113.7a: the ability exists
 * independently of its source, so removing the source doesn't remove the rider). `PendingSpellCopy`
 * carries a `lastKnownSourceSnapshot` that `ZoneTransitionService` stamps at the moment the source
 * leaves the battlefield, and `PredicateEvaluator.evaluateDynamicCap` threads it into the
 * `EffectContext` it reconstructs, so `DynamicAmountEvaluator`'s existing LKI branch resolves it.
 * Stamped at departure rather than at rider creation precisely so the pump is included; a *shrunk*
 * Loki is symmetrically stricter.
