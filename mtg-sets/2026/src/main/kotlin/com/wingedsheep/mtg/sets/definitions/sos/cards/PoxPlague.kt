/**
 * Pox Plague
 * {B}{B}{B}{B}{B}
 * Sorcery
 * Each player loses half their life, then discards half the cards in their hand, then sacrifices
 * half the permanents they control of their choice. Round down each time.
 *
 * A modern Pox/Smallpox. Per the original Pox rulings, the effect is processed in three separate
 * stages, in order — every player loses life, *then* every player discards, *then* every player
 * sacrifices — and the amount for each stage is not calculated until that stage is performed (so an
 * earlier stage's discards/sacrifices change the count for later stages). Each stage is therefore
 * its own [ForEachPlayerEffect] over [Player.ActivePlayerFirst] (APNAP order, CR 101.4), and the
 * three are sequenced with `then`.
 *
 * Within a stage the body's `controllerId` is rebound to the iterated player, so [Player.You] /
 * [EffectTarget.Controller] resolve to that player and the per-player "half, rounded down" amount
 * (`Divide(<count>, Fixed(2), roundUp = false)`) reads *their* own life / hand / permanents:
 * - life loss → `Divide(LifeTotal(You), 2)` to themselves
 * - discard → `Divide(AggregateZone(You, HAND), 2)` (player chooses which cards)
 * - sacrifice → `Divide(AggregateBattlefield(You, Permanent), 2)` permanents "of their choice"
