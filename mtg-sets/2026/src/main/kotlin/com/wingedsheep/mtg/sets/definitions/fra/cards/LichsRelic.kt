/**
 * Lich's Relic — Reality Fracture #57
 * {B} · Artifact — Equipment · Rare
 *
 * When this Equipment enters, you may pay {2}. When you do, for each opponent, destroy up to one
 * target creature or planeswalker that player controls.
 * Equipped creature gets +2/+1.
 * Equip {2}
 *
 * The enters trigger is a "When you do" reflexive (CR 603.12): the optional {2} is the action, and
 * the reflexive ability's targets are chosen only once it has been paid. Its targets are Kaya,
 * Spirits' Justice's one-per-player distribution — up to one creature or planeswalker per opponent
 * (`dynamicMaxCount = PlayerCount(EachOpponent)` + `differentControllers = true`, `optional` for
 * the "up to") — and each chosen permanent is then destroyed.
