 * Forum's Favor — {W}, Sorcery: Target creature gets +1/+0 and gains flying until end of turn.
 *
 * Prepare (Secrets of Strixhaven): the creature enters with the PREPARED keyword. Becoming
 * prepared creates a copy of its prepare spell ("Forum's Favor") in exile that its controller may
 * cast for {W}; casting that copy unprepares the creature. Modeled via [CardLayout.PREPARE] +
 * the `prepare(name) { }` DSL. The +1/+0 buff and granted flying are both EndOfTurn.
