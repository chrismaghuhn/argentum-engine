/**
 * Jace, Reality Sculptor
 * {3}{U}{U}
 * Legendary Planeswalker — Jace
 * Starting Loyalty: 5
 *
 * - +1 is Empower Jace with a dynamic X — the number of Islands you control, read as the ability
 *   resolves.
 * - −3 installs a per-attacker delayed trigger that lives until your next turn
 *   ([DelayedTriggerExpiry.UntilControllersNextTurn]); it is Jace's delayed ability, so it keeps
 *   working if Jace leaves. Each creature declared attacking you or a planeswalker you control
 *   triggers it once, and the −5/−0 goes on that attacker (the triggering entity). A creature
 *   attacking a battle, or a teammate, doesn't trigger it.
 * - 0 counts loyalty counters among every Jace you control (this one, Jace tokens from empower, and
 *   any other Jace) as an activation restriction. Its effect is Doomsday Excruciator's "all but the
 *   bottom N" gather, per opponent: the top (library size − 1) cards, clamped at zero, exiled face
 *   up.
