/**
 * Mind into Matter — Secrets of Strixhaven #202
 * {X}{G}{U} · Sorcery
 *
 * Draw X cards. Then you may put a permanent card with mana value X or less from your hand onto the
 * battlefield tapped.
 *
 * X flows through the resolution context (`DynamicAmount.XValue` for the draw; the chosen X is
 * stamped on the context, exactly as for Mind Spring / Nature's Rhythm). The optional put is the
 * stock `Patterns.Hand.putFromHand` pipeline (Gather hand → optional `ChooseUpTo(1)` Select → Move
 * to battlefield tapped); the candidate filter is `Permanent.manaValueAtMostX()`, which reads the
 * same chosen X at selection time. Drawing first matters: a card just drawn this turn is a legal
 * choice to put onto the battlefield.
