/**
 * Sphinx's Approach — Reality Fracture #41
 * {1}{U}{U} · Instant
 *
 * Draw two cards. Then you may exile this spell and four cards named Sphinx's Approach from your
 * graveyard. If you do, search your library for a Sphinx creature card, put it onto the
 * battlefield, then shuffle.
 * A deck can have any number of cards named Sphinx's Approach.
 *
 * - The optional payment is all-or-nothing: an `Effects.May` over a `Gate.DoAction` whose success bar
 *   is four graveyard cards actually exiled (`CollectionNonEmpty(min = 4)`). With fewer than four
 *   other copies in the graveyard the option isn't a legal choice (CR 608.2d), so the gated-effect
 *   executor skips the prompt entirely and the spell goes to the graveyard as usual.
 * - "Exile this spell" happens *during* resolution: `CardSource.Self` gathers the resolving spell
 *   off the stack and the pipeline exiles it alongside the four graveyard copies. Once it has left
 *   the stack, the CR 608.2n "put it into its owner's graveyard" step finds nothing to move. The
 *   spell is on the stack, not in the graveyard, so it can never be one of the four.
 * - The deck-construction clause is read from the oracle text by the game server's
 *   `DeckValidator` ("A deck can have any number of cards named …"), like Relentless Rats.
