/**
 * Rewrite History — Marvel Super Heroes #71
 * {2}{U} · Enchantment — Plan
 *
 * Whenever one or more creatures you control become tapped, draw a card, then discard a card and
 * put a plan counter on this enchantment.
 * When the fourth plan counter is put on this enchantment, sacrifice it. When you do, return up to
 * two target instant and/or sorcery cards from your graveyard to your hand.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *  - "One or more creatures you control become tapped" is the batching `Triggers.oneOrMore(filter).becomeTapped(reason)`
 *    (CR 603.2c): tapping several creatures at once (attacking, convoke, crew) fires it exactly once.
 *  - "When the **fourth** plan counter is put on this enchantment" composes from existing
 *    vocabulary: a SELF-bound `Triggers.<subject>.getsCounters(type, by, firstTimeEachTurn, batch)` on [CounterType.PLAN] gated by
 *    `triggerRestriction = `[Conditions.SourceCounterCountAtLeast]`(PLAN, 4)`. The at-least gate is
 *    behaviourally exact here because the payoff **sacrifices its own source**, so the enchantment
 *    is gone before a fifth counter could ever land — the threshold can never fire twice. No
 *    dedicated "Nth counter" trigger event is needed.
 *  - "Sacrifice it. When you do, …" is a mandatory [ReflexiveTriggerEffect] (`optional = false`):
 *    the sacrifice is the action and the return is a genuine second stack object (CR 603.12) whose
 *    up-to-two targets are chosen as it goes on the stack.
