/**
 * Page, Loose Leaf — Secrets of Strixhaven #250
 * {2} · Legendary Artifact Creature — Construct · 0/2
 *
 * {T}: Add {C}.
 * Grandeur — Discard another card named Page, Loose Leaf: Reveal cards from the top of your library
 * until you reveal an instant or sorcery card. Put that card into your hand and the rest on the
 * bottom of your library in a random order.
 *
 * Grandeur (CR 207.2c) is an ability word — flavor only, no rules meaning. The ability is a normal
 * activated ability whose cost is "discard another card named Page, Loose Leaf". The discard cost
 * draws from the controller's hand; the source on the battlefield is never a candidate, so "another"
 * is satisfied automatically (any *other* Page copy in hand is the discard fodder).
 *
 * The reveal half composes [GatherUntilMatchEffect] (walk the library until the first instant or
 * sorcery) + [RevealCollectionEffect] + two filtered [MoveCollectionEffect]s: the matched
 * instant/sorcery → hand, the rest → the bottom of the library in a random order ([CardOrder.Random]).
 * GatherUntilMatch stops at the first instant/sorcery, so "the rest" is exactly the non-matching
 * revealed cards.
