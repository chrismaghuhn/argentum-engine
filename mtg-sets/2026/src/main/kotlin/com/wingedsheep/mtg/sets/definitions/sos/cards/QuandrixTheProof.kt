/**

 * 6/6
 *
 * Flying, trample
 * Cascade
 * Instant and sorcery spells you cast from your hand have cascade.
 *
 * Cascade is itself a "when you cast this spell" triggered ability (CR 702.85a), so both halves
 * are modelled as cast triggers feeding the shared [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.effects.CascadeEffect]
 * executor (which reads the triggering spell's mana value to set the threshold):
 *  - Quandrix's own cascade fires on `Triggers.self.isCast()` (SELF), reading Quandrix's
 *    mana value.
 *  - The granted cascade fires whenever the controller casts an instant or sorcery spell from
 *    their hand, mirroring Wildsear, Scouring Maw. Granting the trigger rather than literally
 *    stamping the CASCADE keyword onto the stacked spell produces identical game behavior, and
 *    the from-hand restriction is expressed with [SpellCastPredicate.CastFromZone].
