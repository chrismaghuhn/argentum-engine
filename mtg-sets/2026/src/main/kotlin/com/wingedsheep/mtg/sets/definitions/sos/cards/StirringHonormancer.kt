/**
 * Stirring Honormancer — Secrets of Strixhaven #234
 * {2}{W}{W/B}{B} · Creature — Rhino Bard · 4/5
 *
 * When this creature enters, look at the top X cards of your library, where X is the number of
 * creatures you control. Put one of those cards into your hand and the rest into your graveyard.
 *
 * The "look at top X, keep one in hand, rest to graveyard" shape is the
 * [Patterns.Library.lookAtTopAndKeep] recipe (Gather top X → Select exactly 1 → Move kept to hand →
 * Move rest to graveyard). X = creatures you control, counting the Honormancer itself since it's on
 * the battlefield when this ETB resolves; [SelectionMode.ChooseExactly] clamps to the size of the
 * gathered pile, so an empty or smaller library is handled gracefully.
