/**
 * Flow State

 * Sorcery
 *
 * Look at the top three cards of your library. Put one of them into your hand and the rest on
 * the bottom of your library in any order. If there is an instant card and a sorcery card in
 * your graveyard, instead put two of them into your hand and the rest on the bottom of your
 * library in any order.
 *
 * The dig is the standard look-at-top-and-keep pipeline. The number kept is conditional: 2 when
 * the graveyard holds both an instant card and a sorcery card, otherwise 1. The condition is
 * evaluated at resolution, so it reads the graveyard at the time the spell resolves.
