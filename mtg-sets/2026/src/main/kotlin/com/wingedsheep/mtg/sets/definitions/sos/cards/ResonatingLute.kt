/**
 * Resonating Lute

 * Artifact
 * Lands you control have "{T}: Add two mana of any one color. Spend this mana only to cast instant
 * and sorcery spells."
 * {T}: Draw a card. Activate only if you have seven or more cards in your hand.
 *
 * The static ability grants every land you control a [ManaRestriction.InstantOrSorceryOnly] mana
 * ability that adds two mana of one chosen colour (Add **any one** colour — [Effects.AddAnyColorMana]
 * with `amount = 2`, not a free combination). The card's own `{T}: Draw a card` is gated by
 * [ActivationRestriction.OnlyIfCondition] on [Conditions.CardsInHandAtLeast] (7) — a "loot when
 * flooded" payoff that turns excess cards into more draws.
