 * Target player discards two cards. Put up to one land card discarded this way onto the
 * battlefield tapped under your control.
 *
 * One inline [Effects.Pipeline]: gather the target player's hand and have *them* choose exactly two
 * to discard ([Chooser.TargetPlayer], [MoveType.Discard] → their graveyard). The selected slot keeps
 * referencing those two cards after they land in the graveyard, so we [filter] it down to land cards,
 * let *you* (the controller) pick up to one of those, and move it to the battlefield tapped under your
 * control. If neither discarded card is a land, the land filter empties and the up-to-one selection is
 * a no-op — matching "up to one".
