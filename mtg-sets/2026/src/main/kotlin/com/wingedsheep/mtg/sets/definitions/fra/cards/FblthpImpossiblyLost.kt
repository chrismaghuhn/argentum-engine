/**
 * Fblthp, Impossibly Lost — Reality Fracture #213
 * {1}{U} · Legendary Creature — Homunculus · 1/1
 *
 * When one or more of your opponents are dealt combat damage during your turn, draw two cards.
 * If your library has no cards in it, you win the game. Fblthp's owner shuffles him into their
 * library. (If you draw from an empty library this way, you still win the game.)
 *
 * The trigger is the opponent-keyed combat-damage batch
 * (`Triggers.anOpponent.isDealtCombatDamage()`) — once per combat-damage step however many
 * opponents were hit — narrowed to your turn with a trigger restriction.
 *
 * The reminder text works because drawing from an empty library doesn't lose on the spot: the
 * attempt is recorded and the loss is the state-based action of CR 704.5b, checked only after the
 * whole ability has resolved. The win check (CR 104.2b) runs first and ends the game. The win check
 * precedes the shuffle, so Fblthp himself never refills the library he is judged on.
