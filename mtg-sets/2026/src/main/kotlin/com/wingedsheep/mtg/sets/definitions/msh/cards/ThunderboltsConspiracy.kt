/**
 * Thunderbolts Conspiracy — Marvel Super Heroes #117
 * {3}{B} · Enchantment · Rare
 *
 * Flash
 * Whenever a Villain you control dies, return it to the battlefield under its owner's control with a
 * finality counter on it. That creature is a Hero in addition to its other types.
 *
 * The Valkyrie's Call template: a filtered dies trigger (`Triggers.<subject>.leaves(to, excludeTo, excludeSacrifice)` to
 * [Zone.GRAVEYARD], [TriggerBinding.ANY]) whose filter is "Villain creature you control".
 * [EffectTarget.TriggeringEntity] resolves to the dying card, now in the graveyard;
 * [Effects.Move] returns it to the battlefield under its owner's control (the reanimation default)
 * *with* the [CounterType.FINALITY] counter — `addCounterType`, not a following AddCounters, because
 * "with a counter on it" is an as-enters replacement (CR 614.1c): the counter rides the zone change,
 * so counter doublers and "enters with an additional counter" effects see it enter carrying the
 * counter, and it is never briefly on the battlefield without one. The [Duration.Permanent] Hero
 * type-add then applies to the new object created by that return (CR 611.2b — the effect has no
 * duration, so it modifies the object for as long as it stays on the battlefield).
 *
 * The finality counter's "if it would die, exile it instead" replacement is engine-intrinsic to
 * [CounterType.FINALITY], so the loop self-terminates on the creature's second death. A token Villain
 * dying leaves nothing to return — the Move is a graceful no-op, matching the rules.
