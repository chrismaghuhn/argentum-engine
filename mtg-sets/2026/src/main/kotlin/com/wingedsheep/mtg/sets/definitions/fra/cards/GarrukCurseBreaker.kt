/**
 * Garruk, Curse Breaker
 * {3}{G}{G}
 * Legendary Planeswalker — Garruk
 * Starting Loyalty: 5
 *
 * - The first line is Garruk's Uprising's draw trigger on a planeswalker: a filter-scoped
 *   enters trigger over creatures you control with power 4 or greater (the filter reads the
 *   entering creature's projected power, so static pumps and entry counters count).
 * - +2 is one "up to two target lands" requirement (distinct objects, zero allowed), untapped
 *   per target with [ForEachTargetEffect].
 * - −4 installs a filter-scoped delayed trigger (`Triggers.anOpponent.isAttacked()`) that lives
 *   until Garruk's controller's next turn ([DelayedTriggerExpiry.UntilControllersNextTurn]) — it is
 *   Garruk's delayed ability, so it keeps working after Garruk leaves the battlefield. It fires once
 *   per attack declaration in which at least one creature attacks one of your opponents, and
 *   "those creatures" are the creatures attacking one of your opponents
 *   ([GameObjectFilter.attackingAnOpponent]) — creatures attacking a planeswalker or battle don't
 *   get the bonus.
