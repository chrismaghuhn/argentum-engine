/**
 * Chelonian Tackle
 * {2}{G}
 * Sorcery
 *
 * Target creature you control gets +0/+10 until end of turn. Then it fights up to one
 * target creature an opponent controls. (Each deals damage equal to its power to the other.)
 *
 * Two targets, the second "up to one" (optional). The pump (`Effects.ModifyStats(0, 10,
 * EndOfTurn)`) applies to the creature you control regardless of whether a fight target was
 * chosen; the fight then reuses `Effects.Fight`, whose opponent target is optional — so if the
 * second target is declined or becomes illegal, the creature is still pumped but no fight
 * occurs. Mirrors Dragonclaw Strike's "pump then fights up to one" shape.
