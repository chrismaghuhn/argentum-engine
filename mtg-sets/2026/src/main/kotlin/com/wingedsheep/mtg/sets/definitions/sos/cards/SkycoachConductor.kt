/**
 * Skycoach Conductor // All Aboard — Secrets of Strixhaven #67
 * {2}{U} · Creature — Bird Pilot · 2/3
 *
 * Flash
 * Flying, vigilance
 * This creature enters prepared. (While it's prepared, you may cast a copy of its spell.
 * Doing so unprepares it.)
 * //
 * All Aboard — {U}, Instant: Exile target non-Pilot creature you control, then return that card to
 * the battlefield under its owner's control.
 *
 * Prepare (Secrets of Strixhaven): the creature enters with the PREPARED keyword. Becoming prepared
 * creates a copy of its prepare spell ("All Aboard") in exile that its controller may cast for {U};
 * casting that copy unprepares the creature. Modeled via [com.wingedsheep.sdk.model.CardLayout.PREPARE]
 * + the `prepare(name) { }` DSL.
 *
 * "All Aboard" is a self-blink: exile the chosen non-Pilot creature you control, then move that card
 * back to the battlefield. Routing it through exile makes it a new object (CR 400.7), and a
 * battlefield re-entry with no controllerOverride defaults to the owner — matching "return that card
 * to the battlefield under its owner's control."
