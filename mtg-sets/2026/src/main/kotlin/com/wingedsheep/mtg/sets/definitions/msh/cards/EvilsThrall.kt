/**
 * Evil's Thrall — Marvel Super Heroes #128
 * {2}{R} · Sorcery
 *
 * Gain control of target creature until end of turn. If you control a Villain with greater mana
 * value than that creature, gain control of that creature until the end of your next turn instead.
 * Untap that creature. It gains haste until end of turn.
 *
 * A Threaten (Act of Treason) with one rider: the steal lasts a whole extra turn when your board
 * has a *bigger* Villain than the creature you are borrowing.
 *
 * **"Instead" is a single control change, not two.** The second sentence replaces the first's
 * duration rather than adding a second effect, so the script is one [Effects.If] whose two
 * branches differ only in [Duration] — never `GainControl(EndOfTurn)` followed by a second grab.
 * One control change means one `ControlChangedEvent` and one summoning-sickness stamp either way.
 *
 * **The condition.** "You control a Villain with greater mana value than that creature" is the
 * greatest mana value among Villains you control being strictly greater than the target's mana
 * value — `AggregateBattlefield(MAX)` returns 0 for an empty set, so controlling no Villain can
 * never satisfy `> targetManaValue` (a mana-value-0 target included: 0 is not greater than 0, and
 * neither is a Villain that merely *ties* the target). Filtering by the Villain **subtype** over
 * `GameObjectFilter.Permanent` (not `Creature`) is this set's idiom for "a Villain" and matches
 * CR 205.3: "a Villain" is any permanent with that subtype. The subtype and controller halves of
 * the aggregate read projected state, so a creature that only has the Villain type from a
 * continuous effect (Ultron, Absorbing Man) counts. Mana value itself is read off the card
 * component, so a projection that only changes types does not move it.
 *
 * The target may itself be a Villain you control — the printed text does not exclude it, and the
 * comparison handles it: it can never out-value itself, so only a *different*, bigger Villain
 * extends the duration.
 *
 * **Haste is not extended.** Only the control change gets the longer duration; the printed haste
 * grant is "until end of turn" in both branches. That costs nothing on the extra turn — the
 * creature has been under your control continuously since that turn began, so CR 302.6's
 * summoning-sickness rule is already satisfied.
 *
 * Effect order follows the printed order (control, then untap, then haste), the Twisted Fealty
 * idiom, so the untap and the keyword grant both land on a creature already under your control.
