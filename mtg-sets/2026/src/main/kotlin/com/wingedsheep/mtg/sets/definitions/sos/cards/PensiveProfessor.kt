/**
 * Pensive Professor — Secrets of Strixhaven #63
 * {1}{U}{U} · Creature — Human Wizard · 0/2
 *
 * Increment (Whenever you cast a spell, if the amount of mana you spent is greater than this
 *   creature's power or toughness, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature.)
 * Whenever one or more +1/+1 counters are put on this creature, draw a card.
 *
 * Increment is supplied by the [increment] ability-word builder (already in the engine). The draw
 * payoff fires on a [CountersPlacedEvent] bound to this creature ([TriggerBinding.SELF]); unlike
 * Exemplar of Light there is no "once each turn" restriction, so the trigger has no `oncePerTurn`.
