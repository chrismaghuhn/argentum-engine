/**
 * Kiora of Salt and Sand
 *
 * - "Whenever you attack" fires once per attack declaration; "if you've activated a loyalty
 *   ability this turn" is an intervening if (checked on trigger and on resolution) over the
 *   per-player loyalty-activation turn tracker, so a planeswalker that has since died still counts.
 * - The untap and "can't be blocked this turn" both land on the one target attacking creature —
 *   any attacking creature, not only yours.
 * - The −8 is granted to every planeswalker you control, so it follows the loyalty rules of the
 *   planeswalker it's on.
