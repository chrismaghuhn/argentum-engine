/**
 * Mister Hyde, Monster Within (MSH #176) — {2}{G} Legendary Creature — Human Villain · 2/2
 *
 * At the beginning of your upkeep, choose one —
 * • Put a +1/+1 counter on Mister Hyde.
 * • Remove a counter from a creature you control. If you do, draw a card.
 *
 * A modal *triggered* ability (CR 603.3c) on `Triggers.you.beginningOf(Step.UPKEEP)`, built as a
 * [ModalEffect.chooseOne] the way White Widow, Free Agent builds its enters trigger. Neither mode
 * targets, so both the mode and the creature are chosen without targeting — the mode as the
 * ability goes on the stack (CR 601.2b), the creature on resolution.
 *
 * Mode 2's creature is therefore picked mid-resolution with [Effects.SelectTarget] into a pipeline
 * slot (the Agatha's Soul Cauldron shape) rather than declared as a target, and the draw hangs off
 * [Effects.IfYouDo] with [SuccessCriterion.CountersRemoved] — counter removal is not a zone move, so
 * `Auto` can't infer it and a creature with no counters must not draw. Any kind of counter counts,
 * not just +1/+1.
 *
 * [Effects.RemoveCounterOfAnyKind] is the removal primitive: the controller picks which kind to
 * take off, but not *whether* — exactly one counter comes off. The ceiling-only
 * [Effects.RemoveCountersUpTo]`(1, …)` would let a player who chose this mandatory mode answer 0
 * to every prompt on a creature that does have counters and still draw.
