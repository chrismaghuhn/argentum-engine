/**
 * Vastlands Scavenger // Bind to Life — Secrets of Strixhaven #166
 * {1}{G}{G} · Creature — Bear Druid · 4/4
 *
 * Deathtouch
 * This creature enters prepared. (While it's prepared, you may cast a copy of its spell.
 * Doing so unprepares it.)
 * //
 * Bind to Life — {4}{G}, Instant: Mill seven cards. Then put a creature card from among them
 * onto the battlefield.
 *
 * Prepare (Secrets of Strixhaven): the creature enters with [Keyword.PREPARED]; becoming prepared
 * creates a copy of its prepare spell ("Bind to Life") in exile that its controller may cast for
 * {4}{G}, and casting that copy unprepares the creature. Modeled via [CardLayout.PREPARE] +
 * the `prepare(name) { }` DSL.
 *
 * Bind to Life mills seven (gather top 7 → graveyard), then puts a creature card from among the
 * milled cards onto the battlefield: a [SelectFromCollectionEffect] of exactly one creature from
 * the milled collection (auto-selects none if no creature was milled) followed by
 * [MoveCollectionEffect] to the battlefield. The select reads the milled collection, which still
 * tracks the cards' refs after they hit the graveyard.
