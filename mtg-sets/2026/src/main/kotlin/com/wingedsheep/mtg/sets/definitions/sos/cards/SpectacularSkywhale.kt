/**
 * Spectacular Skywhale
 * {2}{U}{R}
 * Creature — Elemental Whale
 * 1/4
 * Flying
 * Opus — Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell, this creature gets +3/+0 until end of
 * turn. If five or more mana was spent to cast that spell, put three +1/+1 counters on this
 * creature instead.
 *
 * "Opus" is an ability word (flavor only). The `opus { }` builder wires the spell-cast trigger
 * and the 5+ mana tier. The counters *replace* the +3/+0 buff ("instead"), so they're
 * `insteadIfFiveOrMore` (see Colorstorm Stallion for the `alsoIfFiveOrMore` sibling shape).
