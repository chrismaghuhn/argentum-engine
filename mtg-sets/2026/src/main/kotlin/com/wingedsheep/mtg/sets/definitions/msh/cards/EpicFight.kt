/**
 * Epic Fight — Marvel Super Heroes #166
 * {2}{G} · Sorcery · Rare
 *
 * Choose one or both —
 * • Double target creature's power and toughness until end of turn.
 * • Target creature you control fights target creature an opponent controls.
 *
 * "Choose one or both" is `modal(chooseCount = 2, minChooseCount = 1)` — at least one mode, at
 * most both, with no extra cost. Modes are chosen and targeted at cast time (CR 601.2b) and
 * resolve in printed order, so doubling first and then fighting with the doubled creature is a
 * legal line when both modes are chosen.
 *
 * "Double its power and toughness" is the standard layer-7c +N/+N modification where N is the
 * creature's power / toughness read at resolution — Bulk Up's shape with both halves dynamic
 * instead of just power. The bonus is locked in when the effect is applied, so it does
 * not feed back on itself, and a creature with negative toughness is left alone rather than
 * halved-then-doubled. Each mode's targets are scoped to that mode, so
 * [DynamicAmounts.targetPower]`()` / [DynamicAmounts.targetToughness]`()` — index 0 by default —
 * read *this* mode's creature.
