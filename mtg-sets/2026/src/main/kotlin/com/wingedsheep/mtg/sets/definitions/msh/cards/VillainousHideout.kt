/**
 * Villainous Hideout
 * Land
 * {T}: Add {C}.
 * {T}: Add one mana of any color. Spend this mana only to cast a Villain spell or to activate an
 * ability of a Villain source.
 * {3}, {T}: Target Villain you control connives. Activate only as a sorcery.
 *
 * Implementation note: the filtered mana is the Unclaimed Territory shape —
 * [ManaRestriction.SubtypeSpellsOrAbilitiesOnly] with `creatureOnly = false`, covering both the
 * spell and the ability clause. The connive names its own permanent as the counter recipient, so
 * it's the plain [Effects.Connive] over a cast-time `target(...)` (not `ConniveTargeting`, which
 * picks a *different* recipient reflexively at resolution). The target is permanent-scoped, not
 * creature-scoped: CR 701.50a has connive instruct a *permanent*, and "Villain you control" is the
 * bare tribal noun, so a noncreature Kindred — Villain is a legal target. "Activate only as a
 * sorcery" is [TimingRule.SorcerySpeed].
