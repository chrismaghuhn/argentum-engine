/**
 * Inspired Tethermage — Reality Fracture #109
 * {2}{G} · Creature — Elf Warrior · 3/2
 *
 * Whenever you put one or more loyalty counters on a planeswalker, put a +1/+1 counter on this
 * creature.
 * {6}: Empower Jace 2.
 *
 * "You put" is the placer axis (CR 122.6), not the recipient's controller: it covers a [+N]
 * loyalty cost you pay (CR 606.4), a planeswalker entering under your control with its loyalty
 * (CR 122.6a), and effects you control — empower Jace included — whichever player's planeswalker
 * gets them. It fires once per planeswalker per placement, every time (no "first time each turn").
