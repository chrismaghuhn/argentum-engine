/**
 * Tester of the Tangential — Secrets of Strixhaven #69
 * {1}{U} · Creature — Djinn Wizard · 1/1
 *
 * Increment (Whenever you cast a spell, if the amount of mana you spent is greater than this
 * creature's power or toughness, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature.)
 * At the beginning of combat on your turn, you may pay {X}. When you do, move X +1/+1 counters
 * from this creature onto another target creature.
 *
 * The second ability is a may-pay-{X} reflexive: [Effects.MayPayX] pauses for the X chooser and
 * binds the chosen X into [DynamicAmount.XValue], then resolves its inner pipeline — select
 * "another target creature", then [Effects.MoveCounters] moves X +1/+1 counters from this creature
 * (capped at the number present) onto the selected target. Targeting happens after the payment, as
 * the "When you do" reflexive prescribes.
