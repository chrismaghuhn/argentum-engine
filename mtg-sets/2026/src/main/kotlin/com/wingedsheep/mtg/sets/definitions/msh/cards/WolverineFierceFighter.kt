/**
 * Wolverine, Fierce Fighter — Marvel Super Heroes #240 (rare)
 * {2}{R}{G} · Legendary Creature — Mutant Berserker Hero · 3/5
 *
 * Haste
 * When Wolverine enters, he fights up to one other target creature.
 * If damage would be dealt to Wolverine, instead that damage is dealt, but all other damage
 * already dealt to him is healed.
 *
 * The healing factor is the set's only **heal** (CR 701.69a) card and the only damage replacement
 * in the SDK that leaves the amount alone: `HealOtherDamage` lets the damage through in full and
 * wipes whatever was marked before it. Net effect — Wolverine only ever carries the most recent
 * damage *event*, so he survives any number of separate 4-damage hits but still dies to a single
 * 5, and still dies to deathtouch or to −X/−X shrinking him under his marked damage.
 *
 * "All combat damage is dealt simultaneously" (CR 510.2) is what makes double-blocking him work:
 * the heal fires once for the step, so two 3-power blockers still stack 6 damage on him and kill
 * him. The first-strike step is a *separate* event, so a first-striker's damage is healed away
 * before the regular step — which is the card's real trick.
 *
 * The ETB is an ordinary `Effects.Fight` with an optional `OtherCreature` target ("up to one
 * other"), so it resolves harmlessly when the board is empty or the target is removed in response.
