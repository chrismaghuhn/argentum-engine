/**
 * Ajani Unrelenting
 * {4}{R}{R}
 * Legendary Planeswalker — Ajani
 * Starting Loyalty: 5
 *
 * - The first line is a triggered ability on Ajani over `Triggers.you.activatesAbility(loyalty = true)`, so
 *   it fires for Ajani's own loyalty abilities too (Ajani is on the battlefield as the cost is
 *   paid), and for any other planeswalker you activate. The Cadet resolves before the loyalty
 *   ability that caused it, so a +1 pumps and hastes that Cadet and the −2 counts it.
 * - −2 is Change of Fortune's "discard your hand, then draw" shape: the draw count is read after
 *   the discard, as the printed "then" demands.
 * - −3 excludes only tokens *you* control: every nontoken creature, plus an opponent's tokens.
 *   That is a heterogeneous OR ([GameObjectFilter.or]) — nontoken creature, or creature an
 *   opponent controls. Ajani's own nontoken creatures are hit.
