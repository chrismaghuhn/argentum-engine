/**
 * Draconic Visitor — Reality Fracture #80
 * {3}{R}{R} · Creature — Dragon · 5/5
 *
 * Flying
 * If one or more artifact tokens would be created under your control, that many 5/5 red Dragon
 * creature tokens with flying are created instead.
 *
 * A [ReplaceTokenCreationWithToken] scoped to artifact tokens created under your control: Treasure,
 * Clue, Food, artifact creature tokens and token copies of artifacts are all swapped one-for-one
 * for 5/5 flying Dragons. The Dragons aren't artifacts, so the replacement can't apply to its own
 * output, and none of the replaced effect's riders ("tapped", "sacrifice it at end of turn") carry
 * over to them.
