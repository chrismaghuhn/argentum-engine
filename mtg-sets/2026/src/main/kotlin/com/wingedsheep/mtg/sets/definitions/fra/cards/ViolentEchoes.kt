 * Violent Echoes deals 6 damage to target creature or planeswalker. If excess damage was dealt to
 * that permanent this way, empower Jace X, where X is that excess damage.
 *
 * The damage step stores its excess (CR 120.4a — above lethal for a creature, above loyalty for a
 * planeswalker) in a pipeline number slot (`runStoringNumber` + `excessDamageVariable`); the empower is gated on it being
 * positive, so no excess means no Jace token is created.
