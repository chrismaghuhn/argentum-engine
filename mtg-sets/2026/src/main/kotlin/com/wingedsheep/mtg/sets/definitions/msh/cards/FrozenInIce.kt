/**
 * Frozen in Ice
 * {2}{U}
 * Enchantment — Aura
 *
 * Enchant creature
 * When this Aura enters, tap enchanted creature.
 * Enchanted creature loses all abilities and can't become untapped.
 *
 * The Stop Cold / Blossombind idiom: an ETB [Effects.Tap] on the enchanted creature plus a Layer 6
 * [LoseAllAbilities] and an untap restriction. The printed wording is the *stronger*
 * [AbilityFlag.CANT_BECOME_UNTAPPED] (as on Blossombind), which blocks explicit untap effects and
 * untap costs too — not just the controller's untap step, which is all `DOESNT_UNTAP` (Stop Cold)
 * covers.
