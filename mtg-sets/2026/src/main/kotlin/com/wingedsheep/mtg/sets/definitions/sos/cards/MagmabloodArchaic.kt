/**
 * Magmablood Archaic
 * {2/R}{2/R}{2/R}
 * Creature — Avatar
 * 2/2
 *
 * Trample, reach
 * Converge — This creature enters with a +1/+1 counter on it for each color of mana spent to cast it.
 * Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell, creatures you control get +1/+0 until end of turn
 * for each color of mana spent to cast that spell.
 *
 * The {2/R} hybrid cost makes the colour count entirely a function of how you pay: all generic/red
 * still counts as (at most) one colour, but multicolour payment pushes the Converge counters and the
 * spell-trigger pump higher. The enter-with-counters part is [convergeEntersWithCounters] (reads this
 * creature's own cast via [DynamicAmount.DistinctColorsManaSpent]); the spell-cast pump reads the
 * *triggering* spell's colour count via [DynamicAmounts.colorsSpentOnTriggeringSpell] (the
 * `ContextPropertyKey.COLORS_SPENT_ON_TRIGGERING_SPELL` captured from `SpellCastEvent`).
