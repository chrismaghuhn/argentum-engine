/**
 * Entrust the Spark — "You may sacrifice a planeswalker. If you do, …" is a resolution-time
 * [MayEffect] around an [IfYouDoEffect]: the sacrifice is a Gather → Select → Sacrifice pipeline
 * over the planeswalkers you control, and only when one was actually sacrificed does the library
 * search (for any planeswalker card, straight onto the battlefield, then shuffle) run. With no
 * planeswalker to sacrifice the "may" isn't offered and the spell does nothing.
