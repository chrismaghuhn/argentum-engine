/**
 * Unbury
 * {1}{B}
 * Instant
 *
 * Choose one —
 * • Return target creature card from your graveyard to your hand.
 * • Return two target creature cards that share a creature type from your graveyard
 *   to your hand.
 *
 * Both modes target (CR 601.2c). The second mode's pair is one two-slot requirement with
 * [TargetObject.sameCreatureType], which reads a graveyard card's printed creature types (a
 * changeling card has them all). Each target is returned on its own.
 *
 * Known engine gap: the 2025-11-17 ruling says that if one of the pair leaves the graveyard the
 * other still returns, but `ModalEffectExecutor` re-checks a pre-chosen mode's targets
 * all-or-nothing (CR 608.2b partial legality isn't modelled for modes), so today the whole mode
 * does nothing in that case.
