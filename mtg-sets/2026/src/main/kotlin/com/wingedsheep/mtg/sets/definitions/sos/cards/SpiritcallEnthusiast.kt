/**
 * Spiritcall Enthusiast // Scrollboost — Secrets of Strixhaven #33
 * {2}{W} · Creature — Cat Cleric · 3/3
 *
 * Whenever one or more tokens you control enter, this creature becomes prepared.
 * (While it's prepared, you may cast a copy of its spell. Doing so unprepares it.)
 * //
 * Scrollboost — {1}{W} · Sorcery: One or two target creatures each get +2/+2 until end of turn.
 *
 * Prepare (Secrets of Strixhaven): Spiritcall Enthusiast does NOT enter prepared (no PREPARED
 * keyword). It becomes prepared via its trigger — whenever one or more tokens you control enter —
 * through [Effects.BecomePrepared]. Becoming prepared creates a copy of its prepare spell
 * ("Scrollboost") in exile that its controller may cast for {1}{W}; casting that copy unprepares
 * the creature. Modeled via `CardLayout.PREPARE` + the `prepare(name) { }` DSL, like Leech
 * Collector. The token-enter trigger is the shared `OneOrMorePermanentsEnter(Token)` batch enter
 * (defaults to "you control"). Scrollboost's "one or two target creatures" is the variable-count
 * `TargetCreature(count = 2, minCount = 1)` fanned out by [ForEachTargetEffect].
