/**
 * Celestial Reunion
 * {X}{G}
 * Sorcery
 *
 * As an additional cost to cast this spell, you may choose a creature type and behold two
 * creatures of that type.
 * Search your library for a creature card with mana value X or less, reveal it, put it into
 * your hand, then shuffle. If this spell's additional cost was paid and the revealed card is
 * the chosen type, put that card onto the battlefield instead of putting it into your hand.
 *
 * Implementation note: Oracle text frames the type-choice + behold as a cast-time additional
 * cost. We model the entire spell at resolution time as an optional Effects.May that chooses
 * a creature type and reveals two matching creatures from your battlefield + hand. Because
 * Behold has no cost component (it does not exile or pay anything), evaluating it at
 * resolution time produces equivalent gameplay: the chosen type is stored in
 * `chosenValues["chosenCreatureType"]`, and the conditional placement reads it via
 * `withSubtypeFromVariable`. If the player declined the may, the variable stays unset and
 * `CollectionContainsMatch` resolves to false, sending the revealed card to hand.
