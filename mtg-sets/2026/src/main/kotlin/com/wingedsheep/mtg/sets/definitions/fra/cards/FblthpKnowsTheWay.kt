/**
 * Fblthp, Knows the Way — Reality Fracture #258
 * {X}{G}{G} · Legendary Creature — Homunculus Scout · * /2
 *
 * Domain — Fblthp's power is equal to the number of basic land types among lands you control.
 * When Fblthp enters, search your library for up to X basic land cards with different names,
 * reveal them, put them into your hand, then shuffle.
 *
 * Power is the Domain characteristic-defining value ([DynamicAmounts.domain]). The trigger's X is
 * the X paid for the spell ([DynamicAmount.XValue]) — zero when Fblthp entered without being cast.
 * The search is the Three Dreams pipeline: `ChooseUpTo(X)` under
 * [SelectionRestriction.OnePerCardName] ("with different names") → hand, revealed → shuffle.
