/**
 * Ajani Resolute
 * {1}{W}
 * Legendary Planeswalker — Ajani
 * Starting Loyalty: 2
 *
 * - The static-looking first line is a triggered ability on the planeswalker itself: each life-gain
 *   event is one trigger, one loyalty counter (`Triggers.you.gainsLife()`).
 * - −4's token is a *named* token ("Ajani's Pridemate") carrying its own Pridemate trigger, the same
 *   shape Teferi, Temporal Pilgrim uses for its Spirit token.
 * - −10 is a permanent emblem over creatures you control, so creatures that arrive later also get
 *   +2/+2.
