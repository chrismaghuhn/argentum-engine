/**
 * Karn, Argent Defender — Reality Fracture #279
 * {2} · Legendary Artifact Creature — Golem · 1/3 · Rare
 *
 * Artifacts and creatures entering the battlefield don't cause abilities to trigger.
 *
 * Doorkeeper Thrull's lock on a colorless body: [SuppressEntersTriggers] widened from its
 * creature-only default to [GameObjectFilter.CreatureOrArtifact]. The entering permanent is matched
 * in projected state, replacement effects ("enters tapped", "enters with counters", "as this
 * enters") are untouched, and permanents entering alongside Karn are suppressed too. Karn is itself
 * an artifact creature, so its own entry causes no triggers either.
