/**
 * Identity Echo — Reality Fracture #87
 * {2}{R} · Enchantment
 *
 * {3}{R}: Exile target creature or planeswalker you control. Reveal cards from the top of your
 * library until you reveal a creature or planeswalker card. Put that card onto the battlefield and
 * the rest on the bottom of your library in a random order. Activate only as a sorcery.
 *
 * The exile is the only targeted step, so an ability whose target has become illegal does nothing
 * at all (CR 608.2b) — no reveal. The reveal walk is `gatherUntilMatch`: it stops at the first
 * creature or planeswalker card and hands back both that card and everything revealed on the way,
 * so the bottom pile is `revealed − match`. If the library holds no creature or planeswalker card,
 * nothing enters and every revealed card goes to the bottom.
