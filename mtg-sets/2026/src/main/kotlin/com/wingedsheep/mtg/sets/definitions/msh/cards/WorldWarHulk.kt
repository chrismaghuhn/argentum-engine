/**
 * World War Hulk — Marvel Super Heroes #197
 * {3}{G}{G} · Enchantment — Saga · Rare
 *
 * I — The next red or green creature spell you cast this turn can be cast without paying its
 *     mana cost.
 * II — Put three +1/+1 counters on target creature you control.
 * III — Choose target creature you control. Until end of turn, double its power and toughness
 *       and it gains trample.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *  - Chapter I is the one new piece of vocabulary: [Effects.GrantNextSpellFreeCast], a one-shot
 *    pending rider on the game state in the same family as Mistrise Village's "next spell can't be
 *    countered" and Don & Raph's "next spell has affinity". The rider — not a battlefield static —
 *    is what the printed text describes: the permission has already resolved, so it survives the
 *    Saga being destroyed in response, and it applies to a spell cast from any zone. It is spent by
 *    the next matching spell *cast*, whether or not the free cast is taken; "the next red or green
 *    creature spell you cast this turn" names a spell, and a matching spell cast for full price is
 *    that spell. Per CR 118.9 the permission is an alternative cost, so mandatory additional costs
 *    still apply, and X is 0 (CR 107.3b) — the free-cast action the enumerator offers carries no X.
 *  - "Red or green creature spell" is a plain filter conjunction — a colour union ANDed with
 *    `Creature`, in that order so the rendered description reads "red or green creature".
 *  - Chapter II is a straight [Effects.AddCounters]; the target is chosen when the chapter ability
 *    triggers and goes on the stack, so a creature that leaves in response makes the chapter fizzle.
 *  - Chapter III is Epic Fight's doubling shape ([Effects.ModifyStats] with both halves read off
 *    the target at resolution — the standard layer-7c +N/+N modification) composed with a trample
 *    grant on the same target. Both halves are "until end of turn" and the bonus is locked in when
 *    applied, so it doesn't feed back on itself.
