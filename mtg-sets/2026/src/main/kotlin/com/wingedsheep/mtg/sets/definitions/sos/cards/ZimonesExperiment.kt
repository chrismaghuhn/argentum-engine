/**
 * Zimone's Experiment
 * {3}{G}
 * Sorcery
 *
 * Look at the top five cards of your library. You may reveal up to two creature and/or land
 * cards from among them, then put the rest on the bottom of your library in a random order.
 * Put all land cards revealed this way onto the battlefield tapped and put all creature cards
 * revealed this way into your hand.
 *
 * Atomic Gather → Select → split-by-type → Move pipeline:
 *  1. Gather the top five cards into a private "looked" pile.
 *  2. Choose up to two creature/land cards (the remainder is everything not chosen).
 *  3. Split the chosen pile by type, routing lands → battlefield tapped, creatures → hand.
 *  4. Bottom the rest in a random order.
 *
 * A chosen pile entry can only be a creature or a land (the selection filter is
 * [GameObjectFilter.CreatureOrLand]); a card that is both a creature and a land would be put
 * onto the battlefield by the land split, matching the printed routing order.
