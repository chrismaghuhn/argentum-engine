/**
 * Decorum Dissertation
 * {3}{B}{B}
 * Sorcery — Lesson
 *
 * Target player draws two cards and loses 2 life.
 * Paradigm (Then exile this spell. After you first resolve a spell with this name, you may cast a
 * copy of it from exile without paying its mana cost at the beginning of each of your first main
 * phases.)
 *
 * Both effects act on the same chosen player — bind one `target player` and feed it to both
 * [Effects.DrawCards] and [Effects.LoseLife] so the recurring Paradigm copy re-targets each turn.
 * `paradigm()` is the SOS ability word that exiles the spell on resolution and synthesizes the
 * recurring "free copy from exile at your first main phase" ability.
