/**
 * Archaic's Agony
 * {4}{R}
 * Sorcery
 *
 * Converge — Archaic's Agony deals X damage to target creature, where X is the number of colors of
 * mana spent to cast this spell. Exile cards from the top of your library equal to the excess
 * damage dealt to that creature this way. You may play those cards until the end of your next turn.
 *
 * Converge is an ability word (no keyword); X is [DynamicAmount.DistinctColorsManaSpent]
 * ([com.wingedsheep.sdk.dsl.DynamicAmounts.colorsOfManaSpent]). Composed from existing atoms:
 *  1. [Effects.DealDamage] deals that color-count to the target and marks the damage.
 *  2. The exile count reads the post-damage excess via
 *     `EntityProperty(ContextTarget(0), ExcessMarkedDamage)` — `max(0, marked − toughness)` (CR 120.4a),
 *     the same amount Hell to Pay reads. CompositeEffect resolves steps sequentially with no
 *     interleaved SBA pass, so the marked damage in scope is exactly what this spell just dealt.
 *  3. Gather that many cards off the top of your library → move them to exile → grant
 *     "you may play them until the end of your next turn" ([MayPlayExpiry.UntilEndOfNextTurn]) —
 *     the impulse-draw shape used by Alania's Pathmaker.
 *
 * If excess is 0 (the creature wasn't overkilled), step 3 gathers 0 cards and is a no-op.
