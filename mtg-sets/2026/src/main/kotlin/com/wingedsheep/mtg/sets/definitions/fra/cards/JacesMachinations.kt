/**
 * Jace's Machinations
 *
 * The first sentence is a turn-scoped player permission lifting only the sorcery-timing half of
 * CR 606.3 for Jace planeswalkers you control — each planeswalker's once-per-turn limit still
 * applies. It is recorded before the empower, so the Jace token that empower may create is covered
 * too. The filter is read when an ability is offered, so a Jace that enters later this turn is also
 * covered.
