/**
 * Omnipresence — Reality Fracture #110.
 *
 * Omniscience with a dynamic cap: a controller-only, hand-only [MayCastWithoutPayingManaCost]
 * whose spell filter is "mana value ≤ the number of creatures you control". The cap is evaluated
 * against the card being cast each time the permission is checked (offered and validated), so it
 * tracks the board as creatures come and go. The free cast is its own action variant — the player
 * still chooses between it and paying normally — and an {X} spell cast this way has X = 0
 * (CR 107.3b), so its mana value in hand is what the cap compares against.
