/**
 * The Kingpin of Crime
 * {1}{W}{B}
 * Legendary Creature — Human Villain
 * 1/5
 *
 * Extort (Whenever you cast a spell, you may pay {W/B}. If you do, each opponent loses 1 life and
 *   you gain that much life.)
 * Whenever you attack, you may pay 2 life. If you do, until end of turn, creatures you control
 *   with toughness greater than their power assign combat damage equal to their toughness rather
 *   than their power.
 *
 *  - **Extort** (CR 702.101) has no `Keyword` of its own here, and it does not need one: it *is*
 *    exactly "whenever you cast a spell, you may pay {W/B}. If you do, each opponent loses 1 life
 *    and you gain that much life", which composes from primitives already in the SDK —
 *    `Triggers.you.casts()` + [Effects.MayPay] over [Effects.DrainLife]. The hybrid `{W/B}`
 *    parses and pays as a hybrid symbol (either color, or two generic-equivalent sources of
 *    either), and `DrainLife(1)` is the single-event "each opponent loses 1, you gain that much"
 *    shape — so a multiplayer drain gains the total, not 1 per opponent. `Effects.MayPay` is
 *    the same shape Shambling Cie'th uses for its cast-triggered optional mana payment.
 *
 *    TODO: promote extort to a first-class `Keyword` (with its own reminder text and a shared
 *    trigger factory) when a second extort card lands — one card doesn't yet justify new SDK
 *    vocabulary, but two do, and the reminder text should not be re-typed per card.
 *
 *  - **The attack ability** is a [Gate.MayPay] over [PayLifeEffect]`(2)` — a cost the engine checks
 *    for affordability before prompting, so a controller who cannot pay is never offered the choice.
 *    `GatedEffectExecutor.canAfford` is `life >= amount`, so paying at exactly 2 life *is* offered:
 *    CR 118.3/118.3b bar only a payment you lack the life for, so paying down to 0 is legal, and it
 *    is the separate state-based action (CR 704.5a) that ends the game afterwards.
 *    Fires on `Triggers.you.attacks()` (declare attackers, once per combat,
 *    regardless of whether the Kingpin himself attacks — he is a 1/5 that would rather stay home).
 *
 *  - **"creatures you control with toughness greater than their power"** stays a *dynamic* set for
 *    the rest of the turn, not a snapshot taken when the trigger resolves. The printed effect
 *    changes no object's characteristics and no object's controller, so by CR 611.2c it modifies
 *    the rules of the game and "can affect objects that weren't affected when that continuous
 *    effect began": a creature that only becomes toughness-heavy later — a combat trick after
 *    blockers, a counter — must pick it up, and one whose power outgrows its toughness must lose it.
 *
 *    So this is not a grant of anything to the creatures. It is the *durational form of Bedrock
 *    Tortoise's printed sentence*, and it is written as exactly that: the Kingpin grants
 *    **himself** [AssignDamageEqualToToughness]`(AllCreaturesYouControl, onlyWhenToughnessGreater…)`
 *    until end of turn. `CombatDamageUtils` reads that ability — printed or granted — at the point
 *    of use, against the final projected power and toughness, so the set is re-decided per creature
 *    per damage step, and both the first-strike and regular steps honor it.
 *
 *    Two shapes are deliberately *not* used. [Effects.ForEachInGroup] + `GrantKeyword` snapshots the
 *    group at resolution, which is right for an ability grant ("creatures you control gain trample")
 *    and wrong for a rules modification. A floating group-flag effect would keep membership dynamic
 *    across projections but resolve its filter in layer 6, before layer 7 has applied — so it still
 *    could not see a toughness pumped after the trigger resolved, which is the whole point here.
 *
 *    Residual: the grant is anchored to the Kingpin, so it stops applying if he leaves the
 *    battlefield mid-turn, where the printed effect would outlive him.
