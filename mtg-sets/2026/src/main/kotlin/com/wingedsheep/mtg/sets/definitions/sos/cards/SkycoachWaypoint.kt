 * Skycoach Waypoint — Secrets of Strixhaven #261
 * Land
 *
 * {T}: Add {C}.
 * {3}, {T}: Target creature becomes prepared. (Only creatures with prepare spells can become prepared.)
 *
 * Prepare (Secrets of Strixhaven): the second ability targets any creature, but only a creature whose
 * card has the [com.wingedsheep.sdk.model.CardLayout.PREPARE] layout can actually become prepared —
 * [Effects.BecomePrepared] is a no-op against any other creature (matching the reminder text). Becoming
 * prepared creates a copy of that creature's prepare spell in its controller's exile that they may cast;
 * casting the copy unprepares the creature.
