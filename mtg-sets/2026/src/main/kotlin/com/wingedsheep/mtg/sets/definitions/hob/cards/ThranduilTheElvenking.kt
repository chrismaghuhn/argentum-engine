/**
 * Thranduil, the Elvenking
 * {2}{B}{G}{U}
 * Legendary Creature — Elf Noble (The Hobbit, rare)
 *
 * "Thranduil has all activated abilities of all Elf cards in your graveyard.
 *  Whenever another legendary Elf you control enters, draw two cards, then discard a card."
 *
 * Implementation:
 *  - The ability grant is [HasAllActivatedAbilitiesOfCards] with `donors = YOUR_GRAVEYARD` — the
 *    graveyard arm of the same primitive that backs Territory Forge (linked exile) and Locus of
 *    Enlightenment (craft materials). `cardFilter` narrows the pool to Elf cards; `receivedBy`
 *    defaults to the source, so Thranduil grants to himself. The engine re-reads the graveyard on
 *    every legality query, so the granted set changes live as Elf cards arrive and leave, and each
 *    ability is granted with *Thranduil* as its source — `{T}` taps him and the donor card's
 *    self-references bind to him (CR 113.7, and the printed ruling that an ability referencing its
 *    own card by name is treated as referencing Thranduil).
 *  - The trigger filters on `Any` rather than `Creature`: the text says "legendary Elf", not
 *    "legendary Elf creature", so a noncreature Elf permanent counts. Same reason the graveyard
 *    filter is "Elf card", not "Elf creature card".
 *
 * Rulings (2026-08-14):
 *  - An activated ability of a donor Elf card that references its own card by name is treated as
 *    referencing Thranduil instead.
 *  - Linked activated abilities (one exiles a card, another refers to "the card exiled with it")
 *    stay linked only while Thranduil has them; losing and regaining the abilities breaks the link.
 *  - Only *activated* abilities are granted — those with a colon in their cost/effect separator,
 *    including keyword abilities whose reminder text contains one.
