 * Stream of Life — {X}{G}, Sorcery: Target player gains X life.
 *
 * Prepare (Secrets of Strixhaven): the creature enters with the PREPARED keyword. Becoming
 * prepared creates a copy of its prepare spell ("Stream of Life") in exile that its controller
 * may cast for {X}{G}; casting that copy unprepares the creature. Modeled via [CardLayout.PREPARE]
 * + the `prepare(name) { }` DSL. The X chosen for the copy's cast feeds [DynamicAmount.XValue].
