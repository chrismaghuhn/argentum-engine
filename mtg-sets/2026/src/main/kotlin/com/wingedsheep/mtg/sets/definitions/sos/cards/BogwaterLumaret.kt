 * Bogwater Lumaret — Secrets of Strixhaven #177
 * {B}{G} · Creature — Spirit Frog · 2/2

 * Whenever this creature or another creature you control enters, you gain 1 life.
 *
 * "This creature or another creature you control enters" is a single `entersBattlefield` trigger
 * filtered to creatures you control with [TriggerBinding.ANY] — `ANY` matches both the source
 * itself and any other creature you control, so it fires once for Bogwater's own ETB and once for
 * each other creature you control that enters. You gain 1 life each time.
