 * Impractical Joke

 *
 * Damage can't be prevented this turn.
 * Impractical Joke deals 3 damage to up to one target creature or planeswalker.
 *
 * The prevention shield is a one-shot continuous effect created at resolution
 * ([Effects.DamageCantBePreventedThisTurn]); it applies for the rest of the turn regardless of
 * whether a target was chosen. The damage targets "up to one" creature or planeswalker, so it is
 * an optional target — the spell still resolves (lifting prevention) even with no target chosen.
