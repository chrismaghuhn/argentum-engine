 * {3}{B} · Creature — Orc Warlock · 4/2

 * //
 * Raise Dead — {B}, Sorcery: Return target creature card from your graveyard to your hand.

 * Prepare (Secrets of Strixhaven): the creature enters with the PREPARED keyword. Becoming
 * prepared creates a copy of its prepare spell ("Raise Dead") in exile that its controller may
 * cast for {B}; casting that copy unprepares the creature. Modeled via [CardLayout.PREPARE] +
 * the `prepare(name) { }` DSL.
