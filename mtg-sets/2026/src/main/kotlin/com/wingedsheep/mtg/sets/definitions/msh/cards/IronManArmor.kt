/**
 * Iron Man Armor — Marvel Super Heroes #248
 * {3} · Artifact — Equipment · Mythic
 *
 * When this Equipment enters, attach it to target creature you control.
 * Equipped creature gets +2/+1 and has flying.
 * {2}: If this Equipment isn't a creature, it becomes a 0/0 Construct Hero artifact creature
 * with flying and "This creature gets +1/+1 for each artifact you control" until end of turn.
 * Equip {2}
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 * - The ETB is the in-set Super Suit / Falcon's Wing Harness idiom: [Effects.AttachEquipment] on
 *   a "target creature you control".
 * - The two grants to the equipped creature are the canonical Equipment statics scoped to
 *   [Filters.EquippedCreature] — [ModifyStats] for +2/+1 and [GrantKeyword] for flying.
 * - The `{2}` animation is guarded by the printed intervening "if this Equipment isn't a
 *   creature" test ([Conditions.SourceMatches] over [GameObjectFilter.Noncreature], read from
 *   projected state so a second activation while already animated does nothing), and the
 *   animation itself is a Layer 7b [BecomeCreatureEffect] on the source. `addTypes = ARTIFACT`
 *   keeps it an artifact (CREATURE is always added and existing types are kept, so it also keeps
 *   the Equipment subtype) — but it does **not** stay attached: an Equipment that is itself a
 *   creature can't equip a creature unless it has reconfigure (CR 301.5c), so the engine's
 *   `UnattachedAurasCheck` (704.5n) unattaches it as a state-based action as soon as the `{2}`
 *   resolves. Animating therefore *costs* the equipped creature its +2/+1 and flying for as long
 *   as the animation lasts, and the Armor has to be re-equipped afterwards.
 * - The granted "gets +1/+1 for each artifact you control" is carried by
 *   [BecomeCreatureEffect.dynamicPower] / [BecomeCreatureEffect.dynamicToughness] rather than a
 *   granted [ModifyStats] static: a dynamic base P/T is recomputed every projection pass, so the
 *   animated Equipment's size tracks the artifact count continuously (and counts itself, so a
 *   lone animated Iron Man Armor is a 1/1). Modelling it as a granted static instead would be
 *   silently dropped — the layer projector doesn't read [ModifyStats] granted at runtime. The
 *   only divergence from the printed card is the layer the bonus lands in (7b base P/T instead
 *   of 7c modification), which is observable only if another effect sets this permanent's base
 *   power/toughness afterwards; +1/+1 counters and other pumps still stack on top as normal.
