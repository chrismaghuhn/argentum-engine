/**
 * Bloodline Recollector // Ancestral Craving — Reality Fracture #49
 * {1}{B} · Creature — Vampire Warlock · 2/2
 *
 * At the beginning of each end step, if three or more creatures died this turn, this creature
 * becomes prepared. (While it's prepared, you may cast a copy of its spell. Doing so unprepares it.)
 * //
 * Ancestral Craving — {B}, Instant: Target player draws three cards and loses 3 life.
 *
 * Prepare: this creature does NOT enter prepared (no PREPARED keyword). Its end-step trigger fires
 * on *each* end step (yours and opponents') and is gated as an intervening-if (CR 603.4) on three
 * or more creatures having died this turn — a global count across all players, expressed as
 * `creaturesDiedThisTurn(Player.Each) >= 3` (tokens count). Becoming prepared creates a copy of its
 * prepare spell ("Ancestral Craving") in exile that its controller may cast for {B}; casting that
 * copy unprepares the creature.
