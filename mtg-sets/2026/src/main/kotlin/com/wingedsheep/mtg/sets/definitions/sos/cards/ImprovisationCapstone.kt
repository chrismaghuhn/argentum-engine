/**
 * Improvisation Capstone
 * {5}{R}{R}
 * Sorcery — Lesson
 *
 * Exile cards from the top of your library until you exile cards with total mana value 4 or
 * greater. You may cast any number of spells from among them without paying their mana costs.
 * Paradigm (Then exile this spell. After you first resolve a spell with this name, you may cast a
 * copy of it from exile without paying its mana cost at the beginning of each of your first main
 * phases.)
 *
 * Same impulse-and-free-cast shape as Dream Harvest, but on your own library: exile from the top
 * until total mana value reaches 4 ([Effects.ExileLibraryUntilManaValue]), then grant free-cast
 * permission for end of turn ([GrantMayPlayFromExileEffect] + [GrantPlayWithoutPayingCostEffect]).
 * `paradigm()` exiles the spell on resolution and synthesizes the recurring free copy.
