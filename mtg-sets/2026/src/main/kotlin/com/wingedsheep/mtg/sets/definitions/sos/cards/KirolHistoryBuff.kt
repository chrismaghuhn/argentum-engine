/**
 * Kirol, History Buff // Pack a Punch — Secrets of Strixhaven #198
 * {R}{W} · Legendary Creature — Vampire Cleric · 2/3
 *
 * Whenever one or more cards leave your graveyard, Kirol becomes prepared.
 * (While it's prepared, you may cast a copy of its spell. Doing so unprepares it.)
 * //
 * Pack a Punch — {1}{R}{W}, Sorcery: Mill a card. Put two +1/+1 counters on target creature.
 * It gains trample until end of turn.
 *
 * Prepare (Secrets of Strixhaven): Kirol does NOT enter prepared (no PREPARED keyword). He becomes
 * prepared only via his trigger — whenever one or more cards leave his controller's graveyard — through
 * [Effects.BecomePrepared] + the batched `Triggers.oneOrMore(filter).leaveYourGraveyard()` trigger. Becoming prepared
 * creates a copy of "Pack a Punch" in exile that its controller may cast for {1}{R}{W}; casting that
 * copy unprepares him. A creature already prepared does not re-prepare, so the trigger is a no-op while
 * he is already prepared. Modeled via [CardLayout.PREPARE] + the `prepare(name) { }` DSL. Pack a Punch
 * composes self-mill ([Patterns.Library.mill]) + two +1/+1 counters + EndOfTurn trample on the target.
