/**
 * Tomik, Orzhov Lawmage — Reality Fracture #206
 * {1}{W} · Legendary Creature — Human Advisor · 2/1
 *
 * Flying
 * Planeswalkers you control have "No more than one creature can attack this planeswalker each
 * combat."
 * {T}: Target creature with a +1/+1 counter on it gains flying until end of turn.
 *
 * The planeswalker clause is the per-defender axis of [AttackerCountLimit]: each planeswalker Tomik's
 * controller controls may be the attacked defender of at most one creature per combat. It caps only
 * attacks *on* those planeswalkers — attacking the player, or another player's planeswalker, is
 * unaffected — and ends the moment Tomik leaves the battlefield.
