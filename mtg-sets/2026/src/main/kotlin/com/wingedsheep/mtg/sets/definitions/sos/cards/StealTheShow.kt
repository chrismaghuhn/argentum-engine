/**
 * Steal the Show
 * {2}{R}
 * Sorcery
 * Choose one or both —
 * • Target player discards any number of cards, then draws that many cards.
 * • Steal the Show deals damage equal to the number of instant and sorcery cards
 *   in your graveyard to target creature or planeswalker.
 *
 * Modeled as a "choose one or both" modal spell (`chooseCount = 2, minChooseCount = 1`),
 * matching the Karai's Technique / Scour for Scrap idiom. Mode 1 is an inline
 * Gather → Select(any number) → Discard → Draw pipeline scoped to the chosen player
 * (`Chooser.TargetPlayer` makes the discard choice, draw count reads the selected
 * collection's count). Mode 2 reads the controller's graveyard for instant/sorcery
 * cards at resolution via `DynamicAmount.Count`.
