/**
 * Encouraging Aviator // Jump — Secrets of Strixhaven #46
 * {2}{U} · Creature — Bird Wizard · 2/3
 *
 * Flying
 * Whenever this creature attacks, it becomes prepared. (While it's prepared, you may cast a copy
 * of its spell. Doing so unprepares it.)
 * //
 * Jump — {U}, Instant: Target creature gains flying until end of turn.
 *
 * Prepare (Secrets of Strixhaven): like Leech Collector, Encouraging Aviator does NOT enter
 * prepared (it has no PREPARED keyword). It only becomes prepared via its attack trigger through
 * [Effects.BecomePrepared]. Becoming prepared creates a copy of its prepare spell ("Jump") in
 * exile that its controller may cast for {U}; casting that copy unprepares the creature. Modeled
 * via [CardLayout.PREPARE] + the `prepare(name) { }` DSL.
