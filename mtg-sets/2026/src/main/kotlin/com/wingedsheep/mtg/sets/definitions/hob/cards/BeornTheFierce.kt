/**
 * Beorn the Fierce — The Hobbit #119
 * {3}{G}{G} · Legendary Creature — Bear Shapeshifter Warrior · Mythic
 * 6/6
 *
 * Trample
 * Other Bears you control get +2/+2.
 * At the beginning of combat on your turn, put a trample counter on up to one target creature you
 * control. It becomes a Bear in addition to its other types. Then if you control three or more
 * Bears, draw two cards.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *  - The anthem is the Elvish Champion shape with `.youControl()` added; `excludeSelf` carries the
 *    "Other". Beorn is himself a Bear, so he still counts toward the draw check below.
 *  - "Up to one target" is `TargetCreature(optional = true)` (→ `minCount = 0`), and the payload runs
 *    through [ForEachTargetEffect] so choosing zero targets skips the counter and the type change
 *    without fizzling the trigger — the draw clause still gets its chance.
 *  - The Bear subtype is [Duration.Permanent], not end-of-turn: the text has no duration, so the
 *    creature stays a Bear (CR 205.1b). It is [Effects.AddSubtype] rather than any "becomes"
 *    primitive that *sets* subtypes — "in addition to its other types" is purely additive.
 *  - The draw check is a plain [Effects.If] evaluated after the type change, and the count is
 *    a projected battlefield read, so the creature that just became a Bear is already counted.
