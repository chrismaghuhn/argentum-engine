/**
 * Follow the Lumarets — Secrets of Strixhaven #148
 * {1}{G} · Sorcery
 *
 * Infusion — Look at the top four cards of your library. You may reveal a creature or land card
 * from among them and put it into your hand. If you gained life this turn, you may instead reveal
 * two creature and/or land cards from among them and put them into your hand. Put the rest on the
 * bottom of your library in a random order.
 *
 * Infusion (SOS ability word, no keyword): the bonus is gated on `Conditions.YouGainedLifeThisTurn`.
 * It folds into the single reveal step as a conditional upper bound on how many creature/land cards
 * you may take — up to 2 if you gained life this turn, otherwise up to 1 — via
 * `SelectionMode.ChooseUpTo(DynamicAmount.Conditional(...))`. This is the look-at-top reveal pipeline
 * (`Patterns.Library.lookAtTopRevealMatchingToHand` shape) inlined so the keep count can be dynamic.
