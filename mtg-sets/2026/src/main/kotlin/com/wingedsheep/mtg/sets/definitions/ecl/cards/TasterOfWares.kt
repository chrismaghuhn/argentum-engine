/**
 * Taster of Wares
 * {2}{B}
 * Creature — Goblin Warlock
 * 3/2
 *
 * When this creature enters, target opponent reveals X cards from their hand,
 * where X is the number of Goblins you control. You choose one of those cards.
 * That player exiles it. If an instant or sorcery card is exiled this way, you
 * may cast it for as long as you control this creature, and mana of any type
 * can be spent to cast that spell.
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 * - The cast-from-exile permission carries `MayPlayExpiry.WhileYouControlSource`,
 *   so it ends the moment this creature leaves the battlefield or someone else
 *   gains control of it. Per CR 611.2b the window is one-way: the grant is not
 *   created at all if the Taster is already gone when the trigger resolves, and
 *   getting it back later does not revive a permission that has ended. The card
 *   stays exiled either way — only the permission ends.
 * - "Mana of any type can be spent" is plumbed via `withAnyManaType = true` on
 *   the granted permission, which relaxes colored cost requirements at cast time.
