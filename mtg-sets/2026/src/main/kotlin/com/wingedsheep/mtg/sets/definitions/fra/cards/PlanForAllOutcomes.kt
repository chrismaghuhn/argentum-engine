 * Enchantment
 *
 * When this enchantment enters, the owner of up to one other target nonland permanent puts it on
 * their choice of the top or bottom of their library.
 * Whenever you cast your first noncreature spell each turn, empower Jace 1.
 *
 * [Effects.PutOnTopOrBottomOfLibrary] asks the target's **owner** for the position (Diver Skaab).
 * The second ability is `Triggers.<player>.castsNth(n, spell)` with a noncreature filter, which counts casts —
 * a countered first noncreature spell still closes the window for the turn.
