/**
 * Splinter, Radical Rat
 * {1}{W/B}{W/B}
 * Legendary Creature — Mutant Ninja Rat
 * 2/4
 *
 * If a triggered ability of a Ninja creature you control triggers,
 * that ability triggers an additional time.
 * {1}{U}: Target Ninja can't be blocked this turn.
 *
 * Mirrors the Lorwyn Eclipsed Twinflame Travelers shape — the
 * trigger-doubler is just `AdditionalSourceTriggers` parameterised
 * on the Ninja subtype. The printed wording is "a Ninja creature you
 * control" (no "another"), so Splinter's own triggered abilities
 * would also be doubled if he had any; `excludeSelf = false` reflects
 * the wording faithfully.
