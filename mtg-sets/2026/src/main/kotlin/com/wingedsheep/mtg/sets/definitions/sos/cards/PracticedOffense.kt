/**
 * Practiced Offense — Secrets of Strixhaven #25
 * {2}{W} · Sorcery
 *
 * Put a +1/+1 counter on each creature target player controls. Target creature gains your choice
 * of double strike or lifelink until end of turn.
 * Flashback {1}{W} (You may cast this card from your graveyard for its flashback cost. Then exile
 * it.)
 *
 * Two independent targets, declared as named bindings: a target player and a target creature.
 * The counter is placed on every creature the *target player* controls via [ForEachInGroup] over
 * a [GroupFilter] scoped with `targetPlayerControls(player)` (the preferred explicit-reference form
 * over implicit first-player resolution), applying [AddCountersEffect] with [EffectTarget.IterationEntity]
 * (the current group member). The "your choice of double strike or lifelink" is a within-resolution
 * choice (not a modal spell), so [ModalEffect.chooseOne] is built with `countsAsModalSpell = false`;
 * the chosen keyword is granted to the target creature until end of turn.
 *
 * Flashback {1}{W} via [KeywordAbility.flashback].
