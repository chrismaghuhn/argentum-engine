/**
 * The Theorist, Jace Beleren
 * {2}{U}{U}
 * Legendary Planeswalker — Jace
 * Starting Loyalty: 3
 *
 * - "At the beginning of each opponent's draw step" is a step trigger scoped to
 *   [Player.EachOpponent] — it fires on every opponent's draw step, and the draw goes to Jace's
 *   controller.
 * - −2 is Kaya, Spirits' Justice's one-per-player distribution: up to one artifact or creature per
 *   opponent (`dynamicMaxCount = PlayerCount(EachOpponent)`, `differentControllers = true`), each
 *   returned to its owner's hand through [ForEachTargetEffect].
 * - −6 reads X after the three draws: the counters are placed per creature with X evaluated at
 *   that point, which is the "then".
