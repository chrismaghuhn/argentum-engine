/**
 * Quill-Blade Laureate // Twofold Intent — Secrets of Strixhaven #27
 * {1}{W} · Creature — Human Cleric · 1/1
 *
 * Double strike
 * This creature enters prepared. (While it's prepared, you may cast a copy of its spell.
 * Doing so unprepares it.)
 * //
 * Twofold Intent — {1}{W}, Sorcery: Target creature gets +1/+0 and gains double strike until end of turn.
 *
 * Prepare (Secrets of Strixhaven): the creature enters with the PREPARED keyword. Becoming
 * prepared creates a copy of its prepare spell ("Twofold Intent") in exile that its controller may
 * cast for {1}{W}; casting that copy unprepares the creature. Modeled via [CardLayout.PREPARE] +
 * the `prepare(name) { }` DSL. The +1/+0 buff and granted double strike are both EndOfTurn.
