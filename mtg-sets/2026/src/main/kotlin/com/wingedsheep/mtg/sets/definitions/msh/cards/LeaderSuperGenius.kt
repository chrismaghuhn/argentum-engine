/**
 * Leader, Super-Genius
 * {2}{U}{U}
 * Legendary Creature — Gamma Scientist Villain
 * 1/3
 *
 * If a creature you control would connive, instead you draw a card, then that creature connives.
 * At the beginning of combat on your turn, target creature you control connives.
 *
 * Implementation note: structurally the same card as Twists and Turns (LCI) with connive in place
 * of explore — a keyword-action prefix replacement plus a recurring source of that action — so both
 * clauses are the shared primitives, not anything card-specific.
 *
 *  - The first clause is a [ModifyKeywordAction] replacement (CR 614) over
 *    [EventPattern.ConnivedEvent]: "if a creature you control would connive, instead <prefix>, then
 *    that creature connives". The prefix is a plain [Effects.DrawCards] of 1. The replacement is
 *    consulted from the battlefield by `ConniveEffectExecutor` whatever the connive's source is —
 *    this card's own trigger, another of your permanents, or an opponent's effect aimed at your
 *    creature — because the filter scopes on the *conniving* permanent, not on the source.
 *  - The extra card is drawn *before* the connive, which is the whole point of the replacement
 *    rather than a "whenever a creature you control connives, draw a card" trigger: you see both
 *    cards before choosing what to discard, and there is no stack object to respond to. A second
 *    Leader adds a second prefix draw (each replacement applies once, CR 614.5).
 *  - The second clause is the ordinary [Effects.Connive] over a cast-time `target(...)`; the
 *    counter recipient is the conniving creature itself (CR 701.50a), so it is not
 *    `ConniveTargeting`, which picks a *different* recipient reflexively at resolution.
