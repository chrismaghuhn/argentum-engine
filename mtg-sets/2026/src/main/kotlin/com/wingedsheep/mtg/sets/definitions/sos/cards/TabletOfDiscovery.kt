 * "Mill a card" puts the top card into the graveyard; the may-play grant then lets the
 * controller play it from the graveyard until end of turn. The grant is keyed to the
 * milled card collection — the cast-from-zone enumerator already honors a
 * [MayPlayPermission] whose card sits in the graveyard, so no exile detour is needed.
