/**
 * Wilt in the Heat — Secrets of Strixhaven #243
 * {2}{R}{W} · Instant
 *
 * This spell costs {2} less to cast if one or more cards left your graveyard this turn.
 * Wilt in the Heat deals 5 damage to target creature. If that creature would die this turn,
 * exile it instead.
 *
 * The cost reduction is a [ModifySpellCost] static on [SpellCostTarget.SelfCast], gated by
 * [CostGating.OnlyIf] with [Conditions.CardsLeftGraveyardThisTurn] (≥1) — evaluated at cast time
 * (the Essence Anchor / Primary Research graveyard-departure tracker). The spell deals 5 damage
 * and then marks the creature with [MarkExileOnDeathEffect], a death-replacement (CR 614) that
 * exiles it instead of letting it die this turn — so even lethal damage from another source
 * sends it to exile rather than the graveyard.
