 * Molten Note

 *
 * Molten Note deals damage to target creature equal to the amount of mana spent to cast this
 * spell. Untap all creatures you control.
 * Flashback {6}{R}{W}
 *
 * "The amount of mana spent to cast this spell" reads [DynamicAmount.TotalManaSpent] — the full
 * mana paid for the resolving spell (the `{X}` portion is already included, e.g. 4 when cast for
 * X=2, or 8 when cast via its {6}{R}{W} flashback). The untap is a `ForEachInGroup` over
 * [Filters.Group.creaturesYouControl] (see Blinkmoth Infusion). Flashback is a keyword ability so
 * the card can be re-cast from the graveyard for {6}{R}{W}.
