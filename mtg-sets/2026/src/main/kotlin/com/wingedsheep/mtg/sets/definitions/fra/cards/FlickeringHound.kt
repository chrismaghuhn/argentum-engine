/**
 * Flickering Hound
 * {3}{W}
 * Creature — Dog
 * 2/2
 *
 * Whenever you cast a creature spell, exile up to one other target creature you control, then
 * return that card to the battlefield under its owner's control.
 *
 * The creature spell being cast is still on the stack when this triggers, so "other" only has to
 * exclude the Hound itself. With no target chosen the trigger does nothing. The return is a plain
 * move to the battlefield, which puts the card under its owner's control; a token that is exiled
 * ceases to exist and doesn't come back.
