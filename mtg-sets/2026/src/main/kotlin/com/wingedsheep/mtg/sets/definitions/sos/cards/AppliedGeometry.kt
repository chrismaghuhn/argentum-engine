/**
 * Applied Geometry
 * {2}{G}{U}
 * Sorcery
 *
 * Create a token that's a copy of target non-Aura permanent you control, except it's a 0/0 Fractal
 * creature in addition to its other types. Put six +1/+1 counters on it.
 *
 * Composed from existing atoms: [Effects.CreateTokenCopyOfTarget] makes the copy and applies the
 * "except it's a 0/0 Fractal creature in addition to its other types" rider —
 * `overridePower/Toughness = 0`, `addCardTypes = {CREATURE}` (unioned on top of the copied types,
 * so an artifact/enchantment copy stays one too — CR 707.9b "in addition to"), and
 * `addedSubtypes = {Fractal}`. The executor publishes the created token under the well-known
 * [CREATED_TOKENS] pipeline collection, so the following
 * [Effects.AddCountersToCollection] puts the six +1/+1 counters on exactly the token just created —
 * no bespoke "copy then counter" effect needed.
 *
 * "non-Aura permanent you control" is expressed by composing `notSubtype(Aura)` onto
 * `GameObjectFilter.Permanent.youControl()` (Auras are the only permanent type that can't legally
 * be copied as a standalone object here).
