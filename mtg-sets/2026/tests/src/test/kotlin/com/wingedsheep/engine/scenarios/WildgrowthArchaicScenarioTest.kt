/**
 * Wildgrowth Archaic ({2/G}{2/G}, 0/0 Avatar, Trample/Reach):
 *   Converge — This creature enters with a +1/+1 counter for each color of mana spent to cast it.
 *   Whenever you cast a creature spell, that creature enters with X additional +1/+1 counters on it,
 *   where X is the number of colors of mana spent to cast it.
 *
 * Pins both `EntersWithDynamicCounters` halves, plus the engine fix that lets the *global* (other-
 * creatures) enters-with path read `DistinctColorsManaSpent` off the **entering** creature's cast
 * rather than off Wildgrowth's own cast:
 *  - Wildgrowth's own converge counters (self path).
 *  - A second creature cast with N distinct colors → N extra +1/+1 counters (the count is about the
 *    entering creature, NOT about Wildgrowth's payment).
 *  - All-colourless cast of the second creature → 0 colours → no extra counters.
 *  - A creature that enters WITHOUT being cast (e.g. put onto the battlefield) → 0 mana spent → 0
 *    colours → no extra counters, matching the "whenever you **cast**" wording.
