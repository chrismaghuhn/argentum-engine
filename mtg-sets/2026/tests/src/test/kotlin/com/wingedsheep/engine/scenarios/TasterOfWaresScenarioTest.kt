/**
 * Scenario tests for Taster of Wares (ECL #121).
 *
 * "When this creature enters, target opponent reveals X cards from their hand, where X is the
 *  number of Goblins you control. You choose one of those cards. That player exiles it. If an
 *  instant or sorcery card is exiled this way, you may cast it for as long as you control this
 *  creature, and mana of any type can be spent to cast that spell."
 *
 * Regression guard for the playtest bug where nothing was ever exiled: the "you choose one of
 * those cards" step was modelled with [SelectionMode.ChooseUpTo], which produces a
 * `minSelections = 0` decision. Declining it — as a player clicking through, or the AI, will —
 * left the collection empty, so the exile step moved nothing. The clause is mandatory, so it must
 * be [SelectionMode.ChooseExactly].
