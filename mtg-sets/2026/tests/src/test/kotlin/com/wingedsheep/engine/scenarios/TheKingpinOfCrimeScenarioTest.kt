/**
 * Scenario tests for The Kingpin of Crime (Marvel Super Heroes #220).
 *
 * {1}{W}{B} · Legendary Creature — Human Villain · 1/5
 *   Extort
 *   Whenever you attack, you may pay 2 life. If you do, until end of turn, creatures you control
 *   with toughness greater than their power assign combat damage equal to their toughness rather
 *   than their power.
 *
 * The attack ability's affected set is **dynamic**, not a snapshot: the effect changes no
 * characteristic and no controller, so under CR 611.2c it modifies the rules of the game and "can
 * affect objects that weren't affected when that continuous effect began". The card grants itself
 * `AssignDamageEqualToToughness` — Bedrock Tortoise's printed sentence — until end of turn, and
 * `CombatDamageUtils` reads that at the point of use against final projected power and toughness.
 * The "pumped after the trigger resolved" test below is what distinguishes that from the
 * snapshotting `ForEachInGroup` + `GrantKeyword` shape it replaced.
