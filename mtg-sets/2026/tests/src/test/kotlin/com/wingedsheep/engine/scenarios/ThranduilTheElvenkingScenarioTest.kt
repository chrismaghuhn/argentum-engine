/**
 * Thranduil, the Elvenking — {2}{B}{G}{U} Legendary Creature — Elf Noble (The Hobbit #167).
 *
 *  - "Thranduil has all activated abilities of all Elf cards in your graveyard."
 *  - "Whenever another legendary Elf you control enters, draw two cards, then discard a card."
 *
 * The first ability is the `DonorCards.YOUR_GRAVEYARD` arm of `HasAllActivatedAbilitiesOfCards`.
 * These tests pin the parts of that arm that could silently regress: the `cardFilter` narrowing,
 * the "**your** graveyard" ownership scope, the live re-read as the graveyard changes, and the
 * CR 113.7 source binding (the granted `{T}` taps *Thranduil*, not the donor card).
