/**
 * Karai, Future of the Foot (TMT #151) — "Whenever Karai deals combat damage to a player, return
 * target creature card from your graveyard to your hand. If her sneak cost was paid this turn,
 * instead return that card to the battlefield."
 *
 * Both branches of the trigger's [com.wingedsheep.sdk.dsl.Effects.If] are
 * exercised: the default (cast normally → return to hand) and the "instead" branch (cast for her
 * sneak cost → put onto the battlefield, since a creature can only be put onto the battlefield by
 * its sneak cost on the very turn it's sneaked in, exactly when the ANDed `SourceEnteredThisTurn`
 * also holds).
