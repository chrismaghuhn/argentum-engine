/**
 * The Eagles Are Coming! {1}{W} — Instant, Kicker {2}{W}{W}.
 *
 * "Choose target creature you own. If this spell was kicked, instead choose any number of target
 *  creatures you own. Return each chosen creature to your hand. At the beginning of the next upkeep,
 *  create a 4/4 white Bird Soldier creature token with flying for each creature returned to your
 *  hand this way."
 *
 * Two things are worth pinning. The kicker changes the *target count* — one creature unkicked, any
 * number kicked — which is a cast-time announcement, not a resolution-time branch. And the token
 * count is settled when the spell resolves, not when the delayed trigger fires an upkeep later: the
 * pipeline collection it counts is long gone by then, so the count has to have been frozen.
 *
 * Tokens are looked up as "Bird Soldier Token" — `CreateTokenExecutor` derives the name from the
 * creature types, so the bare type finds nothing.
