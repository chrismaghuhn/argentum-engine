/**
 * Rockalanche — {2}{G} Sorcery — Lesson
 *
 * Earthbend X, where X is the number of Forests you control. (Target land you
 * control becomes a 0/0 creature with haste that's still a land. Put X +1/+1
 * counters on it. When it dies or is exiled, return it to the battlefield tapped.)
 * Flashback {5}{G} (You may cast this card from your graveyard for its flashback
 * cost. Then exile it.)
 *
 * Earthbend is a keyword *action* composed from existing primitives (animate land +
 * haste + counters + return-tapped self-trigger), not a keyword ability. Here X is
 * dynamic — the number of Forests you control, counted on resolution via
 * [DynamicAmounts.landsWithSubtype] — so the spell uses the dynamic-amount
 * [Effects.Earthbend] overload. Flashback is the card's own keyword ability.
