/**
 * Sidequest: Catch a Fish // Cooking Campsite — Final Fantasy #31
 * {2}{W} · Enchantment // Land
 *
 * Front — Sidequest: Catch a Fish:
 *   At the beginning of your upkeep, look at the top card of your library. If it's an
 *   artifact or creature card, you may reveal it and put it into your hand. If you put a
 *   card into your hand this way, create a Food token and transform this enchantment.
 *
 * Back — Cooking Campsite:
 *   {T}: Add {W}.
 *   {3}, {T}, Sacrifice an artifact: Put a +1/+1 counter on each creature you control.
 *   Activate only as a sorcery.
 *
 * The upkeep ability is a look-top → may-take → reflexive pipeline: gather the top card,
 * offer only an artifact/creature card for the hand, and gate the Food + transform on a card
 * actually being taken (the reveal is a "may", so declining leaves the card on top and the
 * enchantment un-transformed — see the 2025-06-06 ruling). The transform side lives on the
 * land back face's activated abilities.
