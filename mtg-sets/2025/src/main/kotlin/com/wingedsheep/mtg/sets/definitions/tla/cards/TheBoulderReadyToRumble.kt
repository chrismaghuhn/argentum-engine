/**
 * The Boulder, Ready to Rumble
 * {3}{G}
 * Legendary Creature — Human Warrior Performer
 * 4/4
 *
 * Whenever The Boulder attacks, earthbend X, where X is the number of creatures you control with
 * power 4 or greater. (Target land you control becomes a 0/0 creature with haste that's still a
 * land. Put X +1/+1 counters on it. When it dies or is exiled, return it to the battlefield
 * tapped.)
 *
 * The attack trigger (`Triggers.self.attacks()`) targets a land you control and runs the set's
 * [Effects.Earthbend] over a dynamic amount: the count of creatures you control with power 4 or
 * greater ([DynamicAmounts.battlefield] + `powerAtLeast(4)`, `.count()`). The Boulder itself
 * (a 4/4) counts toward X while attacking.
