/**
 * Airbending Lesson — {2}{W} Instant — Lesson
 *
 * Airbend target nonland permanent. (Exile it. While it's exiled, its owner may cast
 * it for {2} rather than its mana cost.)
 * Draw a card.
 *
 * Airbend is a keyword *action*, not a keyword ability — there is no `keywordAbility(...)`.
 * [Effects.Airbend] is target-agnostic: it airbends the spell's chosen target(s) via
 * `CardSource.ChosenTargets`, so the `target("target nonland permanent", …)` declaration
 * supplies the target and the effect needs no explicit argument.
