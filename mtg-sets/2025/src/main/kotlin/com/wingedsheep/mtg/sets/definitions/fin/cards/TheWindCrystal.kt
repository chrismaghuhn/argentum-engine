/**
 * The Wind Crystal
 * {2}{W}{W}
 * Legendary Artifact
 *
 * White spells you cast cost {1} less to cast.
 * If you would gain life, you gain twice that much life instead.
 * {4}{W}{W}, {T}: Creatures you control gain flying and lifelink until end of turn.
 *
 * Notes:
 *  - The cost reduction reduces only generic mana in the total cost of white spells you cast
 *    (Scryfall ruling 2025-06-06); modeled with [CostModification.ReduceGeneric].
 *  - "You gain twice that much life instead" is [ModifyLifeGain] with `multiplier = 2`, scoped
 *    to life gained by you ([Player.You]). Two copies multiply by four, three by eight, etc.,
 *    because each is a separate replacement applied in turn (Scryfall ruling 2025-06-06).
 *  - The activated ability grants flying and lifelink to creatures you control (a group, not a
 *    target) until end of turn.
