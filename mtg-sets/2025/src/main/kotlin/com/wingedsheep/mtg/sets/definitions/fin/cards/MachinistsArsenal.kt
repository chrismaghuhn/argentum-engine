/**
 * Machinist's Arsenal
 * {4}{W}
 * Artifact — Equipment
 * Job select (When this Equipment enters, create a 1/1 colorless Hero creature token,
 *   then attach this to it.)
 * Equipped creature gets +2/+2 for each artifact you control and is an Artificer in addition
 *   to its other types.
 * Machina — Equip {4}
 *
 * The dynamic +2/+2 per artifact is a [GrantDynamicStats] whose bonus recomputes
 * continuously: `Multiply(Count(artifacts you control), 2)`. The Equipment itself (and any
 * artifact creatures) count toward "artifacts you control", matching the printed wording.
 * "Machina" is flavor on the equip ability; it resolves as a standard equip {4}.
