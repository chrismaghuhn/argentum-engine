/**
 * Iroh, Tea Master
 * {1}{R}{W}
 * Legendary Creature — Human Citizen Ally
 * 2/2
 *
 * When Iroh enters, create a Food token.
 * At the beginning of combat on your turn, you may have target opponent gain control of target
 * permanent you control. When you do, create a 1/1 white Ally creature token. Put a +1/+1 counter
 * on that token for each permanent you own that your opponents control.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *  - The ETB Food is the plain [Effects.CreateFood] facade (Canyon Crawler pattern).
 *  - The combat ability declares both targets up front (chosen as the triggered ability is put on
 *    the stack): "target opponent" and "target permanent you control". "you may … When you do" is
 *    the documented `Effects.May(Effects.IfYouDo(action, then))` idiom — [Effects.May] gates the optional
 *    "you may", and [Effects.IfYouDo] with [SuccessCriterion.ControlChanged] gates the payoff on the
 *    control actually changing (the same deliberate gating Stiltzkin, Moogle Merchant uses for its
 *    "if they do" rider). The `action` is [GiveControlToTargetPlayerEffect] handing the chosen
 *    permanent to the chosen opponent.
 *  - The payoff creates the token and then puts +1/+1 counters on it via the [CREATED_TOKENS]
 *    pipeline (Outlaw Stitcher pattern: [Effects.CreateToken] publishes the new token, then
 *    [Effects.AddDynamicCounters] reads it back as `PipelineTarget(CREATED_TOKENS, 0)`).
 *  - "for each permanent you own that your opponents control" (owner ≠ controller) needs no new
 *    [DynamicAmount]: it composes from the existing aggregate + controller-predicate primitives —
 *    [DynamicAmount.AggregateBattlefield] scoped to permanents an opponent *controls*
 *    ([Player.EachOpponent]) further filtered to those *you own*
 *    ([ControllerPredicate.OwnedByYou], which matches the card's immutable `ownerId` against the
 *    ability controller). The just-given-away permanent — still owned by you, now controlled by the
 *    opponent — is therefore counted.
