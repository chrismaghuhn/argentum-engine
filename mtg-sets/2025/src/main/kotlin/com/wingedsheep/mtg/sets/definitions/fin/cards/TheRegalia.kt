/**
 * The Regalia
 * {4}
 * Legendary Artifact — Vehicle
 * 4/4
 * Haste
 * Whenever The Regalia attacks, reveal cards from the top of your library until you reveal a land
 *   card. Put that card onto the battlefield tapped and the rest on the bottom of your library in a
 *   random order.
 * Crew 1
 *
 * The attack trigger is a reveal-until-land pipeline: [GatherUntilMatchEffect] reveals from the top
 * until the first land (stops at one match), publishing everything seen into `allRevealed`.
 * [FilterCollectionEffect] then splits that into the land (`landCard`) and the cards revealed before
 * it (`rest`); the land is put onto the battlefield tapped and the rest go to the bottom of the
 * library in a random order. If the library has no land, no match is found — `landCard` is empty (no
 * permanent enters) and every revealed card goes to the bottom, matching the printed fallback.
