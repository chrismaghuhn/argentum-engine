/**
 * Stalwart Successor — Tarkir: Dragonstorm #227
 * {1}{B}{G} · Creature — Human Warrior · 3/2
 *
 * Menace.
 * Whenever one or more counters are put on a creature you control, if it's the first time
 * counters have been put on that creature this turn, put a +1/+1 counter on that creature.
 *
 * Uses `Triggers.<subject>.getsCounters(type, by, firstTimeEachTurn, batch)` — fires on counters of any type (a null `counterType`) put on a
 * creature you control, gated by the engine's per-creature "first counters this turn" flag.
 * The reward goes on the triggering creature via [EffectTarget.TriggeringEntity]. The +1/+1
 * counter Stalwart itself adds is *not* the first counter of the turn for that creature (the
 * triggering placement already set the marker), so it does not re-trigger — matching the
 * intervening-if once-per-creature-per-turn behavior.
