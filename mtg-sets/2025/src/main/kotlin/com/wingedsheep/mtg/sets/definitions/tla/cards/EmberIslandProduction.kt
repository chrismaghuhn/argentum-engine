/**
 * Ember Island Production
 * {3}{U}{U}
 * Sorcery
 * Choose one —
 * • Create a token that's a copy of target creature you control, except it's not legendary
 *   and it's a 4/4 Hero in addition to its other types.
 * • Create a token that's a copy of target creature an opponent controls, except it's not
 *   legendary and it's a 2/2 Coward in addition to its other types.
 *
 * A "Choose one —" modal spell ([ModalEffect.chooseOne]). Each mode creates a token copy of a
 * targeted creature with the legendary supertype stripped, base P/T overridden, and a creature
 * subtype unioned onto its other types (Hero for your creature, Coward for an opponent's).
