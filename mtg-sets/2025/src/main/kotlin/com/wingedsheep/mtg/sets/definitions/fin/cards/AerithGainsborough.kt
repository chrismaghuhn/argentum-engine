/**
 * Aerith Gainsborough
 * {2}{W}
 * Legendary Creature — Human Cleric
 * 2/2
 *
 * Lifelink
 * Whenever you gain life, put a +1/+1 counter on Aerith Gainsborough.
 * When Aerith Gainsborough dies, put X +1/+1 counters on each legendary creature you control,
 * where X is the number of +1/+1 counters on Aerith Gainsborough.
 *
 * The dies ability uses last-known information for X: the +1/+1 counter count Aerith had as it
 * last existed on the battlefield ([ContextPropertyKey.LAST_KNOWN_PLUS_ONE_COUNTER_COUNT], the
 * same primitive Hooded Hydra's dies trigger uses). X is locked in when the ability resolves, so
 * a simultaneous lethal -1/-1 counter influx still uses the pre-removal +1/+1 count (Scryfall
 * ruling 2025-06-06). The recipients are gathered fresh at resolution (legendary creatures you
 * control), so Aerith — already in the graveyard — does not buff itself.
