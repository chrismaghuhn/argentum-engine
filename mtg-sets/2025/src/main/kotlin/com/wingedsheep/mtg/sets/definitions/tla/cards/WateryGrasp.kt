/**
 * Watery Grasp
 * {U}
 * Enchantment — Aura
 * Enchant creature
 * Enchanted creature doesn't untap during its controller's untap step.
 * Waterbend {5}: Enchanted creature's owner shuffles it into their library. (While paying a
 * waterbend cost, you can tap your artifacts and creatures to help. Each one pays for {1}.)
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 *  - "Enchant creature" → [auraTarget] = [Targets.Creature].
 *  - "Doesn't untap during its controller's untap step" → static
 *    [GrantKeyword] of [AbilityFlag.DOESNT_UNTAP] on the enchanted creature.
 *  - "Waterbend {5}: ..." is an activated ability whose mana cost carries the waterbend
 *    alternative-cost flag ([com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.ActivatedAbility] `hasWaterbend`);
 *    the reminder text (tap artifacts/creatures to pay {1} each) is supplied by the flag.
 *    The effect shuffles the enchanted creature into its owner's library via
 *    [Effects.ShuffleIntoLibrary] on [EffectTarget.EnchantedCreature].
