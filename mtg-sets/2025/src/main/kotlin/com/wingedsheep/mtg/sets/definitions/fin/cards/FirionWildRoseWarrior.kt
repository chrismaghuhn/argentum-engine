/**
 * Firion, Wild Rose Warrior
 * {2}{R}
 * Legendary Creature — Human Rebel Warrior
 * 3/3
 * Equipped creatures you control have haste.
 * Whenever a nontoken Equipment you control enters, create a token that's a copy of it, except it
 * has "This Equipment's equip abilities cost {2} less to activate." Sacrifice that token at the
 * beginning of the next upkeep.
 *
 * First ability: a continuous [GrantKeyword] of haste over the equipped creatures you control
 * (`GameObjectFilter.Creature.youControl().equipped()`), projected each turn.
 *
 * Second ability: a `Triggers.a(filter).enters()` trigger over nontoken Equipment you control
 * (`.nontoken()` also stops the created token — itself an Equipment — from re-triggering, so no
 * loop). It copies the Equipment that entered ([EffectTarget.TriggeringEntity]) via
 * [Effects.CreateTokenCopyOfTarget], granting the copy the "except it has …" clause as an added
 * [ReduceEquipCost] with `onlyOwnEquip = true` (the discount applies only to that token's own
 * equip abilities, not every Equipment you control), and schedules the delayed sacrifice for the
 * next upkeep ([Step.UPKEEP] — the very next upkeep of any player, not gated to your turn).
