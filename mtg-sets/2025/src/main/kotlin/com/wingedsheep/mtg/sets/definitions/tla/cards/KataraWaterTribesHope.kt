/**
 * Katara, Water Tribe's Hope
 * {2}{W}{U}{U}
 * Legendary Creature — Human Warrior Ally
 * 3/3
 *
 * Vigilance
 * When Katara enters, create a 1/1 white Ally creature token.
 * Waterbend {X}: Creatures you control have base power and toughness X/X until end of turn.
 * X can't be 0. Activate only during your turn. (While paying a waterbend cost, you can tap
 * your artifacts and creatures to help. Each one pays for {1}.)
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 *  - "Waterbend {X}" is an activated ability whose mana [cost] carries the waterbend
 *    alternative-cost flag ([com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.ActivatedAbility] `hasWaterbend`); the
 *    reminder text (tap artifacts/creatures to pay {1} each) is supplied by the flag. The chosen X
 *    is read at resolution via [DynamicAmount.XValue].
 *  - "Creatures you control have base power and toughness X/X until end of turn" is an
 *    [Effects.ForEachInGroup] over [GroupFilter.AllCreaturesYouControl] running a
 *    [Effects.SetBasePowerAndToughness] (Layer 7b set values) on each member ([EffectTarget.IterationEntity]
 *    binds to the current iteration creature). The group is snapshotted at resolution, so newly
 *    minted Allies created earlier in the turn are included.
 *  - "Activate only during your turn" → [ActivationRestriction.OnlyDuringYourTurn].
 *  - "X can't be 0" is not separately enforced by the SDK (no minimum-X primitive); following the
 *    Aladdin's Lamp precedent it is documented here. With X=0 every creature you control would be
 *    set to base 0/0.
