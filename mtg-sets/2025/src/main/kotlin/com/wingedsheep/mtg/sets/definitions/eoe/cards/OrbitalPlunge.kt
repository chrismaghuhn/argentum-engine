/**
 * Orbital Plunge

 * Orbital Plunge deals 6 damage to target creature. If excess damage was dealt
 * this way, create a Lander token. (It's an artifact with "{2}, {T}, Sacrifice
 * this token: Search your library for a basic land card, put it onto the
 * battlefield tapped, then shuffle.")

 * Composed from existing atoms — [Effects.DealDamage] writes marked damage to the
 * target, then [Conditions.IfTargetTookExcessDamage] reads the post-damage state to
 * gate the Lander payoff. No bespoke "excess damage detection" executor needed.
