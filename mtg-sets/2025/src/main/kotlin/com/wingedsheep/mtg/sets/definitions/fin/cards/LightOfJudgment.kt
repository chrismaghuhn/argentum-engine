/**
 * Light of Judgment
 * {4}{R}
 * Instant
 *
 * Light of Judgment deals 6 damage to target creature. Destroy up to one Equipment attached
 * to that creature.
 *
 * One target creature, two sequential clauses:
 *  1. [Effects.DealDamage]`(6)` to the target.
 *  2. A non-targeted "up to one" destroy, modeled as a Gather → choose-up-to-1 → destroy
 *     pipeline. [CardSource.AttachedTo] gathers the Equipment attached to the *same* target
 *     (state-based actions that would move the lethally-damaged creature only run after the
 *     spell finishes resolving, so its Equipment is still attached here), then the controller
 *     may pick at most one to destroy via on-battlefield selection (`useTargetingUI`). The
 *     destroy is intentionally *not* a target — it ignores targeting restrictions and is chosen
 *     at resolution, per the oracle wording.
