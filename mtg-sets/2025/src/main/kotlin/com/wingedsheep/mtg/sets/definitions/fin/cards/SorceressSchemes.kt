 * The target is a cross-zone union (CR 115.1 single target, two zone clauses): an instant or sorcery
 * card in your graveyard, OR a card with flashback in your exile that you own — built with
 * [TargetFilter.or]. "Card with flashback" is just the FLASHBACK keyword, which lives in the card's
 * base keywords (derived from its flashback ability) and so matches even on a card in exile.
