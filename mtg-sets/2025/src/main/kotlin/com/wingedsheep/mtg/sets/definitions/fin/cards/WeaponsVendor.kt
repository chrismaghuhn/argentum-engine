/**
 * Weapons Vendor
 * {3}{W}
 * Creature — Human Artificer
 * 2/2
 * When this creature enters, draw a card.
 * At the beginning of combat on your turn, if you control an Equipment, you may pay {1}. When
 *   you do, attach target Equipment you control to target creature you control.
 *
 * The combat ability is the Spellbook Vendor shape: an intervening-"if" gates the trigger on
 * controlling an Equipment, then [Effects.MayPay] models the optional {1} payment whose
 * "when you do" reflexive ability chooses its targets as it goes on the stack (Scryfall
 * ruling). The reflexive payoff reuses [Effects.AttachTargetEquipmentToCreature], moving the
 * chosen Equipment onto the chosen creature.
