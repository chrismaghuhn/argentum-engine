 * Gaius van Baelsar

 * Legendary Creature — Human Soldier
 * 3/2

 * When Gaius van Baelsar enters, choose one —
 * • Each player sacrifices a creature token of their choice.
 * • Each player sacrifices a nontoken creature of their choice.
 * • Each player sacrifices an enchantment of their choice.
 *
 * A modal ETB trigger ([ModalEffect.chooseOne]). Each mode is a symmetric edict over
 * [Player.Each]: every player sacrifices one matching permanent of their own choosing, so no
 * targeting is involved (the choice is made by each player as the ability resolves).
