 *
 * The destroy resolves first, so the creature it kills has already died this turn by the time
 * the draw counts — it is included in the count (per the Scryfall ruling). "Each creature that
 * died this turn" is controller-agnostic, so the count sums [Player.Each]: the number of
 * creatures that died under any player's control this turn.
