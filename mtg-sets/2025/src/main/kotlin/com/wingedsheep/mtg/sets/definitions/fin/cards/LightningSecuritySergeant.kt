/**
 * Lightning, Security Sergeant — Final Fantasy #560
 * {2}{R} · Legendary Creature — Human Soldier · 2/3
 *
 * Menace
 * Whenever Lightning deals combat damage to a player, exile the top card of your library.
 * You may play that card for as long as you control Lightning.
 *
 * The impulse-exile + conditional play permission is the Possibility Technician shape
 * (Gather top → Move to exile → [Effects.GrantMayPlayFromExile] with [MayPlayExpiry.Permanent]
 * and a re-evaluated gate). "For as long as you control Lightning" is modeled as an [Exists]
 * gate for a battlefield creature named "Lightning, Security Sergeant" — Lightning is legendary,
 * so at most one is ever controlled, making this equivalent to controlling the source. As with
 * Possibility Technician, the gate is re-evaluated on every legal-action query, so the permission
 * ends when Lightning leaves; the only divergence from the strict one-way CR 611.2i duration is
 * that it would resume if a new Lightning re-entered your control (the accepted corpus approximation).
