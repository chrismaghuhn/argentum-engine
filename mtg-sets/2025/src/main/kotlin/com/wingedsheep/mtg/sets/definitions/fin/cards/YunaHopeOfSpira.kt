/**
 * Yuna, Hope of Spira — Final Fantasy #250
 * {3}{G}{W} · Legendary Creature — Human Cleric · 3/5
 *
 * During your turn, Yuna and enchantment creatures you control have trample, lifelink, and ward {2}.
 * At the beginning of your end step, return up to one target enchantment card from your graveyard
 * to the battlefield with a finality counter on it.
 *
 * Clause 1 is a conditional ("during your turn") anthem — the FreyaCrescent shape
 * (`staticAbility { condition = Conditions.IsYourTurn }`). It needs two scopes because Yuna is not
 * herself an enchantment creature and there is no battlefield "is source" predicate to union her
 * into the group: [Filters.Self] for Yuna + a `GroupFilter` of enchantment creatures you control.
 * Ward-with-cost is granted via [GrantWard] ([WardCost.Mana]); enforcement reads the configured cost.
 *
 * Clause 2 is the Rydia "return … with a finality counter" idiom: an end-step trigger with an
 * optional ("up to one") graveyard target, moved GRAVEYARD → BATTLEFIELD then given a
 * [CounterType.FINALITY] counter (whose die→exile replacement is engine-intrinsic).
