/**
 * Dragonclaw Strike
 * {2/G}{2/U}{2/R}
 * Sorcery
 *
 * Double the power and toughness of target creature you control until end of turn.
 * Then it fights up to one target creature an opponent controls.
 * (Each deals damage equal to its power to the other.)
 *
 * "Doubling" is modelled per the Comprehensive Rules ruling: the creature gets +X/+X
 * where X is its current power/toughness as the effect applies, so we feed the target's
 * own power/toughness back in as the modification amount (handles negative power too,
 * since the dynamic amount reflects the live value). The fight reuses [Effects.Fight];
 * the opponent's creature is "up to one" so its target is optional.
