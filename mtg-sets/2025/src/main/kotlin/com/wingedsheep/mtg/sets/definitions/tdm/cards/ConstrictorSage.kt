/**
 * Constrictor Sage — Tarkir: Dragonstorm #39
 * {4}{U} · Creature — Snake Wizard · 4/4
 *
 * When this creature enters, tap target creature an opponent controls and put a stun
 * counter on it.
 * Renew — {2}{U}, Exile this card from your graveyard: Tap target creature an opponent
 * controls and put a stun counter on it. Activate only as a sorcery.
 *
 * Both the ETB and the Renew ability are the same tap + stun-counter shape, composed from
 * [Effects.Tap] and [Effects.AddCounters]. A stun counter makes the next untap removal-only
 * (CR 122.1c / the stun counter replacement), keeping the creature tapped one extra cycle.
