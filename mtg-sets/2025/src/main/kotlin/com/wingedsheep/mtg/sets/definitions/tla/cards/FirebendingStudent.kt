/**
 * Firebending Student
 * {1}{R}
 * Creature — Human Monk
 * 1/2
 *
 * Prowess (Whenever you cast a noncreature spell, this creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn.)
 * Firebending X, where X is this creature's power. (Whenever this creature attacks, add X {R}.
 * This mana lasts until end of combat.)
 *
 * Dynamic firebending follows the [com.wingedsheep.mtg.sets.definitions.tla.cards.FireLordZuko]
 * pattern: the fixed `firebending(n)` DSL only models a constant N, so the attack trigger is
 * hand-wired as an [AddManaEffect] producing red mana equal to this creature's (projected) power
 * with [ManaExpiry.END_OF_COMBAT]. Reading projected power means prowess's +1/+1 buffs are
 * already reflected in X when the trigger resolves. The display keyword ability is omitted because
 * the keyword is fixed-N only; the reminder text lives in `oracleText`.
