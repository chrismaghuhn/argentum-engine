/**
 * Summoner's Grimoire
 * {3}{G}
 * Artifact — Book Equipment
 * Job select (When this Equipment enters, create a 1/1 colorless Hero creature token,
 *   then attach this to it.)
 * Equipped creature is a Shaman in addition to its other types and has "Whenever this creature
 *   attacks, you may put a creature card from your hand onto the battlefield. If that card is an
 *   enchantment card, it enters tapped and attacking."
 * Abraxas — Equip {3}
 *
 * Job-select Equipment shell ([jobSelect]) granting the Shaman type plus an attack trigger on the
 * equipped creature ([GrantTriggeredAbility]). The granted ability is a Gather → choose-up-to-one
 * → conditional-placement pipeline:
 *  - gather the controller's creature cards in hand, then `chooseUpTo(1)` models "you may put a
 *    creature card" (declining = choosing zero);
 *  - `filterSplit` on [GameObjectFilter.Enchantment] partitions the chosen card into enchantment
 *    creatures vs. the rest, so the printed conditional ("if that card is an enchantment card, it
 *    enters tapped and attacking") becomes two moves: enchantment creatures enter with
 *    [ZonePlacement.TappedAndAttacking], everything else enters normally. One of the two slots is
 *    always empty, so exactly the chosen card enters.
