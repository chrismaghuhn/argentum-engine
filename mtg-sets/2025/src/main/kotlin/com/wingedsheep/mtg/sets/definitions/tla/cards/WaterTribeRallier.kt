/**
 * Water Tribe Rallier
 * {1}{W}
 * Creature — Human Soldier Ally
 * 2/2
 *
 * Waterbend {5}: Look at the top four cards of your library. You may reveal a creature card
 * with power 3 or less from among them and put it into your hand. Put the rest on the bottom
 * of your library in a random order. (While paying a waterbend cost, you can tap your artifacts
 * and creatures to help. Each one pays for {1}.)
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 *  - "Waterbend {5}" is an activated ability whose mana cost carries the waterbend
 *    alternative-cost flag ([com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.ActivatedAbility] `hasWaterbend`);
 *    the reminder text (tap artifacts/creatures to pay {1} each) is supplied by the flag.
 *  - The effect is the Star Charter "look at top four, reveal a small creature to hand, rest to
 *    the bottom in a random order" shape via [Patterns.Library.lookAtTopRevealMatchingToHand].
