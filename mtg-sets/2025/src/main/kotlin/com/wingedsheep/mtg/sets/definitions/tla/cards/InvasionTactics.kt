/**
 * Invasion Tactics
 * {4}{G}
 * Enchantment
 *
 * When this enchantment enters, creatures you control get +2/+2 until end of turn.
 * Whenever one or more Allies you control deal combat damage to a player, draw a card.
 *
 * The combat-damage clause is a batched offensive trigger
 * ([OneOrMoreDealCombatDamageToPlayerEvent], `TriggerBinding.ANY`): it fires at most once per
 * combat-damage batch no matter how many Allies connected, so a swarm draws exactly one card —
 * a per-source `dealsDamage` trigger would over-draw.
