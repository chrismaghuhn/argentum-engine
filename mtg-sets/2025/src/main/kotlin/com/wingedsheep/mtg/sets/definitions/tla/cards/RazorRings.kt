/**
 * Razor Rings {1}{W}
 * Instant
 *
 * Razor Rings deals 4 damage to target attacking or blocking creature. You gain life equal to
 * the excess damage dealt this way.
 *
 * Composed from existing atoms (mirrors Hell to Pay's excess read): [Effects.DealDamage] deals a
 * fixed 4 to the target and marks the damage, then [Effects.GainLife] reads the post-damage excess
 * via `EntityProperty(EffectTarget.ContextTarget(0), ExcessMarkedDamage)` — `max(0, marked − toughness)`
 * (CR 120.4a). CompositeEffect resolves its steps sequentially with no interleaved SBA pass, so the
 * marked damage in scope at the second step is exactly the 4 this spell just dealt.
