/**
 * Sin, Spira's Punishment
 * {4}{B}{G}{U}
 * Legendary Creature — Leviathan Avatar
 * 7/7
 * Flying
 * Whenever Sin enters or attacks, exile a permanent card from your graveyard at random, then
 *   create a tapped token that's a copy of that card. If the exiled card is a land card, repeat
 *   this process.
 *
 * "Enters or attacks" is the Gilgamesh, Master-at-Arms / Frodo, Determined Hero shape: the engine
 * has no combined enters-or-attacks trigger, so this is two sibling triggered abilities sharing one
 * [sinExileAndCopyLoop] body.
 *
 * The body is a do-while loop ([Effects.RepeatWhile]). Each pass:
 *   1. gathers the permanent cards in your graveyard (`sinGraveyardPool`),
 *   2. picks one at random ([PipelineBuilder.chooseRandom]),
 *   3. moves it to exile, recording it in `sinExiled` ([PipelineBuilder.moveTracked]),
 *   4. creates a tapped token that's a copy of that exiled card
 *      ([Effects.CreateTokenCopyOfTarget] over `sinExiled[0]`).
 * The loop's [RepeatCondition.WhileCondition] re-runs the body while `sinExiled` (this pass's exiled
 * card) is a land — mirroring The Tale of Tamiyo's "repeat this process" over the pass's own
 * collection. The RepeatWhile executor evaluates the condition against the body's own pipeline
 * outputs, so `sinExiled` refers to the card exiled *this* iteration.
 *
 * Empty/no-permanent graveyard is handled gracefully: the gather is empty, so the random select and
 * move are no-ops, the token-copy target resolves to nothing (no token), and the land check is false
 * (loop ends). Because a later pass re-gathers from the graveyard, an already-exiled card can't be
 * repicked.
 *
 * Per the card's rulings, the token copies only the exiled card's printed characteristics (which
 * [Effects.CreateTokenCopyOfTarget] reads from the card), {X} in a copied cost is 0, and any
 * "when this enters" abilities on the copied card trigger for the token as normal.
