/**
 * Sephiroth, Fabled SOLDIER // Sephiroth, One-Winged Angel
 * {2}{B} — Legendary Creature — Human Avatar Soldier 3/3
 *   // Legendary Creature — Angel Nightmare Avatar 5/5
 *
 * Front — Sephiroth, Fabled SOLDIER:
 *   Whenever Sephiroth enters or attacks, you may sacrifice another creature. If you do, draw a card.
 *   Whenever another creature dies, target opponent loses 1 life and you gain 1 life. If this is the
 *   fourth time this ability has resolved this turn, transform Sephiroth.
 *
 * Back — Sephiroth, One-Winged Angel:
 *   Flying
 *   Super Nova — As this creature transforms into Sephiroth, One-Winged Angel, you get an emblem with
 *   "Whenever a creature dies, target opponent loses 1 life and you gain 1 life."
 *   Whenever Sephiroth attacks, you may sacrifice any number of other creatures. If you do, draw that
 *   many cards.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *  - "enters or attacks" has no combined trigger in the engine — it is two sibling triggered
 *    abilities sharing one body (the Gilgamesh / Frodo shape).
 *  - "another creature dies" is a leave-to-graveyard trigger with OTHER binding (excludes Sephiroth
 *    itself), so if Sephiroth dies alongside other creatures the ability still triggers for each of
 *    them but not for itself (CR 603.2). The fourth-resolution transform targets Self, so a dead
 *    Sephiroth simply no-ops that clause — matching the ruling that it "won't transform" in that case.
 *  - The resolution-count clause increments only when the ability actually resolves (an illegal /
 *    countered trigger never runs the increment), so a fizzled trigger doesn't advance the count.
 *  - The Super Nova emblem is a permanent global triggered ability (CreateGlobalTriggeredAbility)
 *    created by the transform-to-back trigger, so it survives Sephiroth leaving and is only granted
 *    by actually transforming (not by entering back-face-up).
