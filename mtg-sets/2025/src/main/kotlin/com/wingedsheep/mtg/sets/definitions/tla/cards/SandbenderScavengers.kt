/**
 * Sandbender Scavengers
 * {W}{B}
 * Creature — Human Rogue
 * 1/1
 *
 * Whenever you sacrifice another permanent, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature.
 * When this creature dies, you may exile it. When you do, return target creature card with
 * mana value less than or equal to this creature's power from your graveyard to the battlefield.
 *
 * Ability 1: modeled with the batching "you sacrifice one or more permanents" trigger (ANY
 * binding) over any permanent. The engine's sacrifice-batch detector only fires ANY-binding
 * triggers; an exact OTHER ("another") binding isn't supported there. The only behavioral gap is
 * the case where this creature is itself sacrificed — the trigger fires and adds a +1/+1 counter
 * to it, but it has already left the battlefield, so that counter is a no-op.
 *
 * Ability 2: a reflexive trigger (Boilerbilges Ripper shape). The "you may exile it" action moves
 * this card from the graveyard to exile; "when you do" then reanimates a target creature card.
 * "This creature's power" is read off the source via last-known information once it is in exile
 * (CR 608.2h), expressed as the [DynamicAmounts.sourcePower] mana-value-vs-power target predicate
 * (Astelli Reclaimer shape). Because the source has been exiled, it can no longer be chosen as the
 * reanimation target.
