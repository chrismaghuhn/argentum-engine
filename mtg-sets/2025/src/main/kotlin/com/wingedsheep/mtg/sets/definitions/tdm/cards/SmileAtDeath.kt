/**
 * Smile at Death — Tarkir: Dragonstorm #24
 * {3}{W}{W} · Enchantment
 *
 * At the beginning of your upkeep, return up to two target creature cards with power 2 or
 * less from your graveyard to the battlefield. Put a +1/+1 counter on each of those creatures.
 *
 * Each chosen graveyard card is returned to the battlefield and then gets a +1/+1 counter,
 * iterated per-target via [ForEachTargetEffect]. The target is optional ("up to two"); the
 * returned card keeps its entity id across the zone move, so `ContextTarget(0)` still resolves
 * to it for the counter (same pattern as Coiling Rebirth).
