/**
 * Beetle-Headed Merchants — Avatar: The Last Airbender #86
 * {4}{B} · Creature — Human Citizen · 5/4
 *
 * Whenever this creature attacks, you may sacrifice another creature or artifact.
 * If you do, draw a card and put a +1/+1 counter on this creature.
 *
 * The attack trigger is a [ReflexiveTriggerEffect]: the optional action is a *non-targeted*
 * `SacrificeEffect` of one creature or artifact you control excluding this creature
 * (`excludeSource = true`), and the reflexive payoff — `Effects.DrawCards(1)` then a +1/+1 counter
 * on this creature ([EffectTarget.Self]) — fires only when you actually sacrifice. The reflexive
 * executor's feasibility check skips the "may" prompt when you control no other creature/artifact,
 * so the payoff can't fire without a sacrifice. This is the rules-correct shape: the ability is not
 * targeted, so the trigger always goes on the stack and can't be fizzled by removing the fodder in
 * response (unlike a `target()`-based sacrifice).
