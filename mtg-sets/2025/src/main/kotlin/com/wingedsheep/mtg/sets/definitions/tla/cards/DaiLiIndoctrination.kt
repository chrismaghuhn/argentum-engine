/**
 * Dai Li Indoctrination — {1}{B} Sorcery — Lesson
 *
 * Choose one —
 * • Target opponent reveals their hand. You choose a nonland permanent card from it.
 *   That player discards that card.
 * • Earthbend 2. (Target land you control becomes a 0/0 creature with haste that's
 *   still a land. Put two +1/+1 counters on it. When it dies or is exiled, return it
 *   to the battlefield tapped.)
 *
 * Mode 1 is a Duress-style targeted discard composed from the reveal/gather/select/move
 * pipeline (controller picks a nonland permanent card from the revealed hand). Mode 2 is
 * the [Effects.Earthbend] keyword action, identical in shape to Earthbending Lesson.
