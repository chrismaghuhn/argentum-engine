/**
 * Foggy Swamp Vinebender
 * {3}{G}
 * Creature — Human Plant Ally
 * 4/3
 *
 * This creature can't be blocked by creatures with power 2 or less.
 * Waterbend {5}: Put a +1/+1 counter on this creature. Activate only during your turn. (While
 * paying a waterbend cost, you can tap your artifacts and creatures to help. Each one pays for {1}.)
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 *  - The evasion clause is the [CantBeBlockedBy] static ability filtered to creatures with power
 *    at most 2 ([GameObjectFilter.Creature.powerAtMost]).
 *  - "Waterbend {5}" is an activated ability whose mana cost carries the waterbend
 *    alternative-cost flag ([com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.ActivatedAbility] `hasWaterbend`); the
 *    reminder text (tap artifacts/creatures to pay {1} each) is supplied by the flag.
 *  - "Activate only during your turn" is [ActivationRestriction.OnlyDuringYourTurn].
