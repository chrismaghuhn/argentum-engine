 * Land — Town
 * {T}: Add {C}.
 * {5}, {T}: Mill two cards. Then you may sacrifice this land. When you do, return another
 *   target permanent card from your graveyard to your hand.
 *
 * The second ability mills two, then composes a [ReflexiveTriggerEffect] for the optional
 * "sacrifice this land. When you do, …" follow-up: the action sacrifices Eden itself
 * ([Effects.SacrificeTarget] of [EffectTarget.Self]), and the reflexive "when you do" returns
 * a permanent card from your graveyard to your hand. Its target is chosen *after* the sacrifice
 * resolves (reflexive trigger targeting), so Eden is already in the graveyard by then;
 * `excludeSelf = true` on the target filter models the "another" restriction by excluding the
 * ability's source (Eden) from the legal returnable cards.
