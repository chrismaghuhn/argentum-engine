/**
 * Serpent of the Pass — Avatar: The Last Airbender #70
 * {5}{U}{U} · Creature — Serpent · Uncommon
 * 6/5
 *
 * If there are three or more Lesson cards in your graveyard, you may cast this spell as though it
 * had flash.
 * This spell costs {1} less to cast for each noncreature, nonland card in your graveyard.
 *
 * Two cast-time statics, both modelled with existing primitives:
 *   - the conditional flash clause is the card-level [conditionalFlash], a [Compare] that the spell
 *     may be cast at instant speed while three or more Lesson-subtype cards sit in your graveyard,
 *   - the cost reduction is a [ModifySpellCost] on the self-cast that reduces generic mana by the
 *     count of noncreature, nonland cards in your graveyard ([CostReductionSource.CardsInGraveyardMatchingFilter]).
