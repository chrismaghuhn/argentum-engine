 * Lasyd Prowler — Tarkir: Dragonstorm #149

 * Renew — {1}{G}, Exile this card from your graveyard: Put X +1/+1 counters on target
 * creature, where X is the number of land cards in your graveyard. Activate only as a sorcery.
 *
 * The Renew ability counts land cards in the graveyard at resolution. Lasyd Prowler itself
 * is exiled as a cost (it is not a land), so it never contributes to X.
