/**
 * Noctis, Prince of Lucis — Final Fantasy #235
 * {1}{W}{U}{B} · Legendary Creature — Human Noble · 4/3
 *
 * Lifelink
 * You may cast artifact spells from your graveyard by paying 3 life in addition to paying their
 * other costs. If you cast a spell this way, that artifact enters with a finality counter on it.
 *
 * The artifact analogue of Leonardo, Sewer Samurai: a [MayCastFromGraveyard] permission (filtered
 * to artifacts, with an additional 3-life cost) plus a non-self [EntersWithCounters] that stamps a
 * finality counter on artifacts you control that were cast from a graveyard. The default
 * `appliesTo` for [EntersWithCounters] is creatures-you-control, so it MUST be overridden to
 * artifacts-you-control here, or the replacement would never fire for non-creature artifacts.
 *
 * As with Leonardo, [Conditions.WasCastFromGraveyard] is true for any graveyard cast of a
 * you-controlled artifact, not strictly via Noctis's permission — the accepted corpus modeling for
 * "if you cast a spell this way" (it only diverges if another effect also grants artifact-from-
 * graveyard casting). The finality counter's die→exile replacement is engine-intrinsic.
