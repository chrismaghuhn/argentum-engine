 * Chef's Knife — During your turn, this creature has first strike and deathtouch.

 * "Enters tapped with a stun counter" is two self-only enters replacements: [EntersTapped]
 * (unconditional) + [EntersWithCounters] of one stun counter. Stun-counter untap consumption
 * is handled engine-side by the tap/untap atom. "During your turn …" is a pair of
 * [ConditionalStaticAbility] keyword grants on [Filters.Self], gated by [Conditions.IsYourTurn].
