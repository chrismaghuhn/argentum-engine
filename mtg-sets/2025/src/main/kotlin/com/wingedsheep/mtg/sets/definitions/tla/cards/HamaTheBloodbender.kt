/**
 * Hama, the Bloodbender
 * {2}{U/B}{U/B}{U/B}
 * Legendary Creature — Human Warlock
 * 3/3
 *
 * When Hama enters, target opponent mills three cards. Exile up to one noncreature, nonland card
 * from that player's graveyard. For as long as you control Hama, you may cast the exiled card during
 * your turn by waterbending {X} rather than paying its mana cost, where X is its mana value. (While
 * paying a waterbend cost, you can tap your artifacts and creatures to help. Each one pays for {1}.)
 *
 * The ETB triggered ability targets an opponent and, in one resolution, mills them three
 * ([Patterns.Library.mill]), then exiles up to one noncreature/nonland card from *that player's*
 * graveyard (a [CardSource.FromZone] over the target's graveyard filtered to
 * `Noncreature and Nonland`, a [SelectionMode.ChooseUpTo] `1` select, then a move to exile), and
 * finally grants the caster a waterbend-cast permission over the exiled card via
 * [Effects.WaterbendCastFromExile]. That grant stamps a
 * `PlayWithFixedAlternativeManaCostComponent(waterbend = true)` whose fixed cost is the exiled card's
 * mana value — the alternative cost is a waterbend {mana value} (CR 701.67): payable with mana and/or
 * by tapping untapped artifacts/creatures, each {1}. The permission persists while the card stays
 * exiled but is gated by `IsYourTurn AND YouControlSource` — re-checked on every legal-action query —
 * so the card is castable only on your turn and only while you still control Hama; once Hama leaves
 * the battlefield [YouControlSource] fails (its `ControllerComponent` is stripped) and the grant ends.
