/**
 * Lotuslight Dancers — Tarkir: Dragonstorm #204
 * {2}{B}{G}{U} · Creature — Zombie Bard · 3/6
 *
 * Lifelink
 * When this creature enters, search your library for a black card, a green card, and a blue card.
 * Put those cards into your graveyard, then shuffle.
 *
 * The ETB is modelled as three sequential single-card library searches — one per color filter —
 * each via the atomic [Patterns.Library.searchLibrary] gather→select→move pipeline to the graveyard.
 * Only the final search shuffles, matching the single "then shuffle" at the end of the oracle text.
 * Each search removes its found card from the library before the next runs, so a card cannot be
 * chosen twice; a multicolor card (e.g. black-green) can satisfy whichever single color search the
 * player picks it for.
