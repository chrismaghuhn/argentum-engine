/**
 * Zack Fair
 * {W}
 * Legendary Creature — Human Soldier
 * 0/1
 *
 * Zack Fair enters with a +1/+1 counter on it.
 * {1}, Sacrifice Zack Fair: Target creature you control gains indestructible until end of turn.
 * Put Zack Fair's counters on that creature and attach an Equipment that was attached to Zack Fair
 * to that creature.
 *
 * Implementation notes — Zack is sacrificed as part of the activation *cost*, so by the time the
 * ability resolves Zack has left the battlefield. Both halves of the resolution therefore read
 * last-known information (CR 112.7a) captured before the cost was paid:
 *
 *  - **Counters** — [Effects.MoveAllLastKnownCounters] moves *every* counter kind Zack had (per the
 *    Bloomburrow/Essence Channeler ruling, and the Zack Fair ruling that it puts the same number of
 *    each kind, not just +1/+1). The executor falls back to the cost-sacrifice last-known map when
 *    there is no dies/leaves trigger.
 *  - **Equipment** — [CardSource.LastKnownEquipmentAttachedToSource] gathers the Equipment that was
 *    attached to Zack (still on the battlefield and still Equipment); [chooseExactly] picks one when
 *    more than one qualifies (auto-resolves with one, no-op with none), then
 *    [Effects.AttachTargetEquipmentToCreature] re-attaches the chosen one to the target creature.
 *
 * Edge cases: no counters → the counter move is a no-op; no qualifying Equipment → the gather is
 * empty, the select stores nothing, and the attach no-ops; the target becoming illegal before
 * resolution fizzles the whole ability (CR 608.2c) since it's the single target.
