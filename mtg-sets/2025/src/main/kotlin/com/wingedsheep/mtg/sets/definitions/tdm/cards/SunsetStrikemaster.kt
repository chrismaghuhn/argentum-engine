/**
 * Sunset Strikemaster — Tarkir: Dragonstorm #126
 * {1}{R} · Creature — Human Monk · 3/1
 *
 * {T}: Add {R}.
 * {2}{R}, {T}, Sacrifice this creature: It deals 6 damage to target creature with flying.
 *
 * The first ability is a vanilla red mana ability ({T}: Add {R}). The second is an activated
 * ability whose cost is the composite of {2}{R}, tapping, and sacrificing the source; on
 * resolution it deals 6 damage to a target creature with flying (via the `withKeyword(FLYING)`
 * target filter). Both abilities tap the source, so they compete for the same tap — exactly as
 * the printed card intends.
