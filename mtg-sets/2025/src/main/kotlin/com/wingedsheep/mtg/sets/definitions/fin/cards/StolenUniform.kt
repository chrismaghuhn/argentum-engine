/**
 * Stolen Uniform
 * {U}
 * Instant
 *
 * Choose target creature you control and target Equipment. Gain control of that Equipment until
 * end of turn. Attach it to the chosen creature. When you lose control of that Equipment this turn,
 * if it's attached to a creature you control, unattach it.
 *
 * Composition (no monolithic executor):
 *  - [Effects.GainControl] of the targeted Equipment, [Duration.EndOfTurn].
 *  - [Effects.AttachTargetEquipmentToCreature] force-attaches it to the chosen creature. Two
 *    independent targets: if the creature target is illegal at resolution, the attach is a no-op but
 *    you still gain control of the Equipment (per the card's ruling).
 *  - A reflexive "when you lose control of that Equipment" delayed trigger
 *    (`Triggers.self.controlChanges(ControlChangeDirection.LOST)` = `ControlChangeEvent(LOST)`) scoped to the Equipment. It
 *    fires on any mid-turn control change away from you and, if the Equipment is still attached to a
 *    creature you control, unattaches it ([Effects.UnattachEquipment]).
