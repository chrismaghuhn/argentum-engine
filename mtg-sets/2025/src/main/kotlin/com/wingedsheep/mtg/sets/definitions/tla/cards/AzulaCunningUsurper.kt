/**
 * Azula, Cunning Usurper
 * {2}{U}{B}{B}
 * Legendary Creature — Human Noble Rogue
 * 4/4
 *
 * Firebending 2 (Whenever this creature attacks, add {R}{R}. This mana lasts until end of combat.)
 * When Azula enters, target opponent exiles a nontoken creature they control, then they exile a
 * nonland card from their graveyard.
 * During your turn, you may cast cards exiled with Azula and you may cast them as though they had
 * flash. Mana of any type can be spent to cast those spells.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 * - The ETB targets an opponent (`Targets.Opponent`); the opponent (`Chooser.TargetPlayer`) makes
 *   both exile choices for their own objects, mirroring Strategic Betrayal's linked-choice flow.
 *   Each chosen card is moved to exile with `linkToSource = true`, stamping Azula's
 *   `LinkedExileComponent` so the pile is "exiled with Azula" (CR 607.2 linked abilities). The two selections are
 *   guarded by [ConditionalOnCollectionEffect] so an opponent with no eligible nontoken creature /
 *   no nonland graveyard card simply skips that half.
 * - The cast grant reuses the from-exile may-play machinery: gather Azula's whole linked-exile pile
 *   and grant a [MayPlayExpiry.Permanent] play permission gated to [IsYourTurn], with
 *   `withAnyManaType = true` ("mana of any type") and the new `asThoughFlash = true` timing rider
 *   ("as though they had flash", CR 702.8) so a sorcery/creature card can be cast at instant speed
 *   on your turn. On opponents' turns the [IsYourTurn] gate closes the permission entirely.
