/**
 * Combustion Technique
 * {1}{R}
 * Instant — Lesson
 *
 * Combustion Technique deals damage equal to 2 plus the number of Lesson cards in your graveyard
 * to target creature. If that creature would die this turn, exile it instead.
 *
 * Damage amount is evaluated on resolution as [DynamicAmount.Add] of 2 and the Lesson-card count in
 * your graveyard. The damage then marks the target with [MarkExileOnDeathEffect], a death-replacement
 * (CR 614) that exiles it instead of letting it go to the graveyard this turn — so even lethal damage
 * from another source sends it to exile. The marker expires at end of turn if it survives.
