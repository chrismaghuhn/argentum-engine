/**
 * Repurposing Bay
 * {2}{U}
 * Artifact
 * {2}, {T}, Sacrifice another artifact: Search your library for an artifact card with mana value
 * equal to 1 plus the sacrificed artifact's mana value, put that card onto the battlefield, then
 * shuffle. Activate only as a sorcery.
 *
 * Cost-linked mana value, so this is the Sidisi, Regent of the Mire chain rather than
 * [com.wingedsheep.sdk.dsl.Patterns.Library.searchLibrary] — that facade takes a static
 * [GameObjectFilter], and there is no "mana value equals <computed>" card predicate. Target
 * validation also runs before cost payment, so the sacrificed artifact's mana value simply isn't
 * knowable at activation time; it has to be read at resolution.
 *
 * The chain mirrors what `searchLibrary(... destination = BATTLEFIELD)` expands to, with the
 * dynamic filter spliced in after the gather:
 *   1. gather every artifact card in your library,
 *   2. keep those whose mana value equals the sacrificed artifact's MV + 1 — read from the cost's
 *      sacrificed permanent via `EffectTarget.SacrificedAsCost(0)` (CR 112.7a / 608.2h; an {X} in the
 *      sacrificed artifact's cost counts as 0, per the 2025-02-07 ruling),
 *   3. choose up to one — `ChooseUpTo`, because searching never requires finding (CR 701.23b),
 *   4. put it onto the battlefield, shuffle, then emit the search event so
 *      "whenever a player searches their library" triggers see it.
