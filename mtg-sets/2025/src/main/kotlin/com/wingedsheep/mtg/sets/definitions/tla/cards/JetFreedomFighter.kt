 * creature an opponent controls.
 * When Jet dies, put a +1/+1 counter on each of up to two target creatures.

 * The enter trigger targets a single creature an opponent controls and deals damage equal to
 * [DynamicAmounts.creaturesYouControl] (counted at resolution, including Jet itself).
 * The dies trigger targets up to two creatures (any controller) as a single optional
 * [TargetCreature] (count = 2, optional), applying one +1/+1 counter to each chosen target via
 * [ForEachTargetEffect] over [EffectTarget.ContextTarget].
