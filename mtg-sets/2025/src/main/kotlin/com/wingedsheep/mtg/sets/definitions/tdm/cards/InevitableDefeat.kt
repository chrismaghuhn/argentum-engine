/**
 * Inevitable Defeat
 * {1}{R}{W}{B}
 * Instant
 * This spell can't be countered.
 * Exile target nonland permanent. Its controller loses 3 life and you gain 3 life.
 *
 * The life loss / gain resolves before the exile so `TargetController` can still read the
 * permanent's controller — exiling first would move it off the battlefield and the
 * controller lookup would silently fail (same ordering trick as Undermine / Agonizing
 * Demise). All three happen in one resolution, so the order is imperceptible to players.
