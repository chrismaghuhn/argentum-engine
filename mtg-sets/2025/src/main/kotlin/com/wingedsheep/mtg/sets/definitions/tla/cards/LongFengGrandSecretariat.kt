/**
 * Long Feng, Grand Secretariat
 * {1}{B/G}{B/G}
 * Legendary Creature — Human Advisor
 * 2/3
 *
 * Whenever another creature you control or a land you control is put into a graveyard from the
 * battlefield, put a +1/+1 counter on target creature you control.
 *
 * Modeled as a per-permanent `Triggers.<subject>.leaves(to, excludeTo, excludeSacrifice)` death trigger scoped to your battlefield:
 * filter [GameObjectFilter.CreatureOrLand] restricted to your control, destination
 * [Zone.GRAVEYARD], and [TriggerBinding.OTHER] for the "another" exclusion (Long Feng's own death
 * doesn't trigger). A board wipe fires it once per qualifying permanent. The counter goes on a
 * [TargetPermanent] creature you control — no self-exclusion, so Long Feng may target itself.
