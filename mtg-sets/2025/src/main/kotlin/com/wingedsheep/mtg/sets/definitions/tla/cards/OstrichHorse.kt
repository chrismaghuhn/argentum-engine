/**
 * Ostrich-Horse
 * {2}{G}
 * Creature — Bird Horse
 * 3/1
 *
 * When this creature enters, mill three cards. You may put a land card from among them into
 * your hand. If you don't, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature. (To mill three cards, put the
 * top three cards of your library into your graveyard.)
 *
 * Modeled as an inline Gather → Move (mill) → optional-choice pipeline: the top three cards go
 * to the graveyard, the milled collection is partitioned on `Land`, and the player may choose up
 * to one land among them to put into their hand. If a land was chosen the chosen slot is
 * non-empty and goes to hand; otherwise (the player declined, or no land was milled) the slot is
 * empty and a +1/+1 counter is placed on this creature — matching "if you don't". The gathered
 * collection tracks entity refs, so selecting from it after the mill move still points at exactly
 * those three cards now in the graveyard.
