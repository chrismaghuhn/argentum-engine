/**
 * The Final Days

 * Create two tapped 2/2 black Horror creature tokens. If this spell was cast from a graveyard,
 * instead create X of those tokens, where X is the number of creature cards in your graveyard.
 * Flashback {4}{B}{B}
 *
 * The "instead" is a single token count chosen at resolution: [DynamicAmount.Conditional] gated on
 * [Conditions.WasCastFromGraveyard] yields the graveyard creature count (true, the flashback cast)
 * or a flat 2 (false, a normal cast). Counting happens while this sorcery is still on the stack, so
