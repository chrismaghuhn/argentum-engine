/**
 * Astrologian's Planisphere
 * {1}{U}
 * Artifact — Equipment
 * Job select (When this Equipment enters, create a 1/1 colorless Hero creature token,
 *   then attach this to it.)
 * Equipped creature is a Wizard in addition to its other types and has "Whenever you cast a
 *   noncreature spell and whenever you draw your third card each turn, put a +1/+1 counter on
 *   this creature."
 * Diana — Equip {2}
 *
 * The granted ability lives on the equipped creature ([GrantTriggeredAbility] over the
 * attached-creature filter), so "you" resolves to the creature's controller and "this creature"
 * ([EffectTarget.Self]) is the bearer. The single printed ability has two trigger conditions, so
 * it is modeled as two granted triggered abilities: `Triggers.you.casts(GameObjectFilter.Noncreature)` and
 * `Triggers.<player>.drawsNth(n)``(3)` (CR 121.2 — "draw your third card each turn"), each adding a
 * +1/+1 counter to the equipped creature.
