/**
 * Perennation

 * Sorcery
 *
 * Return target permanent card from your graveyard to the battlefield with a hexproof counter
 * and an indestructible counter on it.
 *
 * Reanimation that staples on two keyword counters as the permanent enters. Modeled with the
 * same shape as Season of the Burrow's reanimate-with-counters mode: target a permanent card in
 * your graveyard, [Effects.PutOntoBattlefield] it (so it enters as the original object, keeping
 * the entityId), then add a HEXPROOF counter and an INDESTRUCTIBLE counter to that same object.
 * Both are keyword counters mapped in [StateProjector.KEYWORD_COUNTER_MAP], so the permanent
 * gains hexproof and indestructible via projected state for as long as the counters remain.
