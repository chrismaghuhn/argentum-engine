/**
 * Random Encounter
 * {4}{R}{R}
 * Sorcery
 * Shuffle your library, then mill four cards. Put each creature card milled this way onto
 * the battlefield. They gain haste. At the beginning of the next end step, return those
 * creatures to their owner's hand.
 * Flashback {6}{R}{R}
 *
 * Resolution pipeline:
 *   - [ShuffleLibraryEffect] shuffles the controller's library.
 *   - Gather the top four cards as "milled" and move them all to the graveyard (the mill).
 *   - Move only the creature cards among "milled" from the graveyard onto the battlefield,
 *     stamping each as entering via this resolution and stashing them as "reanimated".
 *     Non-creature milled cards stay in the graveyard.
 *   - For each reanimated creature, grant haste and schedule a delayed trigger that returns
 *     it to its owner's hand at the beginning of the next end step. Per-creature delayed
 *     triggers (like Morningtide's Light) capture each creature as a concrete entity at
 *     creation time, so the return fires for exactly the creatures put onto the battlefield.
 *
 * Edge cases: zero creatures milled -> nothing enters and no delayed triggers are scheduled;
 * a creature that has already left the battlefield by the next end step is simply not returned
 * (the baked MoveToZone only acts on it if it's still around).
