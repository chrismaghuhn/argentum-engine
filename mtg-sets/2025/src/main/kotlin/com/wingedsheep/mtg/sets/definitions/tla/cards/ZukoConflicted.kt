/**
 * Zuko, Conflicted
 * {B}{R}
 * Legendary Creature — Human Rogue
 * 2/3
 *
 * At the beginning of your first main phase, choose one that hasn't been chosen and you lose 2 life —
 * • Draw a card.
 * • Put a +1/+1 counter on Zuko.
 * • Add {R}.
 * • Exile Zuko, then return him to the battlefield under an opponent's control.
 *
 * "Choose one that hasn't been chosen" is modeled with [ModalEffect.chooseOneNotYetChosen]: the engine
 * remembers which modes this Zuko has already chosen (in a per-source memory component) and never offers
 * them again. Once all four have been chosen, the ability has no legal mode and does nothing — and the
 * "you lose 2 life" rider is bundled into each mode, so no life is lost when nothing can be chosen. The
 * memory is keyed to the object; the fourth mode (return Zuko under an opponent's control) makes him a
 * new object, resetting the memory for his new controller.
