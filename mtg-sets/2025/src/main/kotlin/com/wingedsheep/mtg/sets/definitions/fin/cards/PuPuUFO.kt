 *
 * The land drop is the standard `Gather → Select(up to 1) → Move` pipeline
 * ([Patterns.Hand.putFromHand]); the `ChooseUpTo(1)` selection models the "you may". The
 * pump is a Layer 7b set-base-power effect ([Effects.SetBasePower]) lasting until end of turn,
 * with the value recomputed at resolution as the count of Town lands the controller has in play.
