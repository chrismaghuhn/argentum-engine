/**
 * Boomerang Basics
 * {U}
 * Sorcery — Lesson
 *
 * Return target nonland permanent to its owner's hand. If you controlled that permanent, draw a card.
 *
 * The "If you controlled that permanent" draw is keyed on whether the spell's controller
 * controlled the bounced permanent — a fact that is only true *before* the permanent leaves
 * the battlefield. So unlike a trailing `.then(...)` clause (Failed Fording's surveil), the
 * control test must be evaluated up front, while the target is still in play. Modeled as a
 * [Effects.If] whose [Conditions.TargetMatchesFilter] gate (resolution-only, over the
 * chosen target) selects between bounce-and-draw and bounce-only — both branches return the
 * permanent, the true branch additionally draws.
