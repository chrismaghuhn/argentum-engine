/**
 * Terra, Magical Adept // Esper Terra (Final Fantasy #245)
 * {1}{R}{G} — Legendary Creature — Human Wizard Warrior 4/2
 * //  — Legendary Enchantment Creature — Saga Wizard 6/6 (Flying)
 *
 * Front — Terra, Magical Adept:
 *   When Terra enters, mill five cards. Put up to one enchantment card milled this way into your hand.
 *   Trance — {4}{R}{G}, {T}: Exile Terra, then return it to the battlefield transformed under its
 *   owner's control. Activate only as a sorcery.
 *
 * Back — Esper Terra (a Summon-style Saga creature):
 *   (As this Saga enters and after your draw step, add a lore counter.)
 *   I, II, III — Create a token that's a copy of target nonlegendary enchantment you control. It gains
 *   haste. If it's a Saga, put up to three lore counters on it. Sacrifice it at the beginning of your
 *   next end step.
 *   IV — Add {W}{W}, {U}{U}, {B}{B}, {R}{R}, and {G}{G}. Exile Esper Terra, then return it to the
 *   battlefield (front face up).
 *
 * The chapter I–III copy is composed from atoms: `CreateTokenCopyOfTarget` (haste via addedKeywords,
 * sacrifice at the controller's next end step via sacrificeAtStep) publishes the token into
 * `CREATED_TOKENS`; a `Effects.If` gated on that collection containing a Saga then runs
 * `AddCountersUpTo(LORE, 3, …)` so the controller may advance the copied Saga's chapters. Chapter IV
 * exile-returns Esper Terra front face up before the CR 714.4 final-chapter sacrifice applies (the
 * chapter is on the stack when lore reaches four, and on resolution the permanent is no longer a Saga),
 * mirroring the Dominant eikon backs — so no sacrifice-opt-out flag is needed.
 *
 * A token copy of a Saga made by chapter I–III enters as a Saga with CR 714.2b's on-enter lore counter
 * (its chapter I triggers) — the token-copy executors route through the shared
 * `ZoneMovementUtils.applySagaEntryIfNeeded` Saga-entry hook, so the "put up to three lore counters"
 * clause stacks on top of that starting counter.
