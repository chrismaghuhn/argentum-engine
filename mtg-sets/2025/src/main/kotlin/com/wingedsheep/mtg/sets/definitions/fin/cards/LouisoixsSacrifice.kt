/**
 * Louisoix's Sacrifice — Final Fantasy #59
 * {U} · Instant
 *
 * As an additional cost to cast this spell, sacrifice a legendary creature or pay {2}.
 * Counter target activated ability, triggered ability, or noncreature spell.
 *
 * The additional cost is the alternative "sacrifice a [filter] or pay {N}" shape, modeled with
 * [Costs.additional.SacrificeOrPay]: the enumerator offers two cast paths — sacrifice a legendary
 * creature you control (base {U}), or pay {2} on top of the base cost. With no legendary creature
 * to sacrifice, only the pay path is offered (CR 601.2b/f — the player picks which way to pay).
 *
 * The target is the union "(any activated/triggered ability) OR (noncreature spell)" — a creature
 * spell is NOT a legal target, while abilities and noncreature spells are. Expressed as
 * [TargetFilter.anyOf] of the prebuilt stack-ability and noncreature-spell clauses; the targeting
 * system enumerates each clause and unions the results (TargetFinder), and the counter dispatches
 * by what's actually on the stack at resolution via [Effects.CounterSpellOrAbility].
