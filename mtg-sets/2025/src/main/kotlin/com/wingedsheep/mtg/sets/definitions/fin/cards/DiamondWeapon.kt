/**
 * Diamond Weapon
 * {7}{G}{G}
 * Legendary Artifact Creature — Elemental
 * 8/8
 * This spell costs {1} less to cast for each permanent card in your graveyard.
 * Reach
 * Immune — Prevent all combat damage that would be dealt to Diamond Weapon.
 *
 * Three existing primitives, no new mechanic:
 *   - A self-cast [ModifySpellCost] reducing generic by [CostReductionSource]
 *     `CardsInGraveyardMatchingFilter(Permanent)` — "{1} less for each permanent card in your
 *     graveyard" (CR 601.2f cost reduction).
 *   - [Keyword.REACH].
 *   - A continuous [PreventDamage] replacement (CR 615) scoped to combat damage
 *     ([DamageType.Combat]) dealt to itself ([Recipient.Self]). Per Scryfall ruling this
 *     prevention isn't considered while a trampling attacker it blocks assigns lethal damage
 *     (CR 510.1c handles that at assignment time, before the replacement applies).
