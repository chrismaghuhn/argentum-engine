/**
 * The Cave of Two Lovers
 * {3}{R}
 * Enchantment — Saga
 *
 * (As this Saga enters and after your draw step, add a lore counter. Sacrifice after III.)
 * I — Create two 1/1 white Ally creature tokens.
 * II — Search your library for a Mountain or Cave card, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle.
 * III — Earthbend 3. (Target land you control becomes a 0/0 creature with haste that's still a land.
 *       Put three +1/+1 counters on it. When it dies or is exiled, return it to the battlefield tapped.)
 *
 * Chapter II tutors a card with the Mountain or Cave land subtype to hand (revealed), then shuffles.
 * Chapter III's earthbend is a keyword action composed from existing primitives via [Effects.Earthbend]
 * and needs a target land chosen as the chapter ability goes on the stack.
