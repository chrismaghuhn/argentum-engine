 * The attack trigger deals damage from Barret (the default source for a triggered ability) to the
 * defending player; the amount is the count of equipped creatures you control
 * ([DynamicAmounts.equippedCreaturesYouControl] — creatures with at least one Equipment attached,
 * each counted once, CR 301.5). Evaluated at resolution, so it includes Barret itself if equipped.
