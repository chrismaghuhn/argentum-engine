/**
 * Ancient Adamantoise
 * {5}{G}{G}{G}
 * Creature — Turtle
 * 8/20
 * Vigilance, ward {3}
 * Damage isn't removed from this creature during cleanup steps.
 * All damage that would be dealt to you and other permanents you control is dealt to this
 * creature instead.
 * When this creature dies, exile it and create ten tapped Treasure tokens.
 *
 * The redirection is modelled as two static [RedirectDamage] replacements — one for damage to
 * the controller ([Recipient.You]) and one for damage to their permanents
 * ([Recipient.Object] over `Permanent.youControl()`). Both redirect to [EffectTarget.Self].
 * Damage already headed to the Adamantoise itself is left alone (the engine skips a redirect
 * whose destination equals the original recipient, CR-faithful "other permanents").
 *
 * Because it soaks damage from the whole board, the marked damage must persist so it can
 * eventually become lethal — hence [DamagePersistsThroughCleanup], an exception to the CR 514.2
 * cleanup damage-removal turn-based action. Per the card's ruling, other damage-removal effects
 * (regeneration, "remove all damage") are unaffected; only the cleanup step is suppressed.
 *
 * The dies trigger functions from the graveyard (`triggerZone = Zone.GRAVEYARD`) so "exile it"
 * can reference [EffectTarget.Self].
