/**
 * Opera Love Song
 * {1}{R}
 * Instant
 * Choose one —
 * • Exile the top two cards of your library. You may play those cards until your next end step.
 * • One or two target creatures each get +2/+0 until end of turn.
 *
 * Mode 1 is impulse draw: [Patterns.Exile.impulse] gathers the top two cards into exile and grants a
 * play permission. The window is "until your next end step" — [MayPlayExpiry.UntilNextEndStep], which
 * (unlike the default end-of-turn expiry) keeps the cards playable through the end step of *this* turn
 * when cast on your own turn and otherwise lasts into your next turn.
 *
 * Mode 2 is "one or two target" — a single requirement with min 1 / max 2 targets locked at cast
 * (`TargetObject(count = 2, minCount = 1)`), then [ForEachTargetEffect] applies +2/+0 until end of
 * turn to each chosen creature.
