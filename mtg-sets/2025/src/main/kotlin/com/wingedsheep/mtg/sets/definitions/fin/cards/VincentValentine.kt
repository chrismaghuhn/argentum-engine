/**
 * Vincent Valentine // Galian Beast
 * {2}{B}{B} — Legendary Creature — Assassin 2/2 // Legendary Creature — Werewolf Beast 3/2
 *
 * Front — Vincent Valentine:
 *   Whenever a creature an opponent controls dies, put a number of +1/+1 counters on Vincent
 *   Valentine equal to that creature's power.
 *   Whenever Vincent Valentine attacks, you may transform it.
 *
 * Back — Galian Beast:
 *   Trample, lifelink
 *   When Galian Beast dies, return it to the battlefield tapped (front face up).
 *
 * The counter trigger reads the dying creature's power via
 * `DynamicAmount.EntityProperty(EffectTarget.TriggeringEntity, EntityNumericProperty.Power)`, which
 * resolves with last-known information once the creature has left the battlefield (CR 112.7a) —
 * matching the official ruling "Use the creature's power as it last existed on the battlefield."
 * Galian Beast's death trigger is a plain `Effects.PutOntoBattlefield(Self, tapped = true)`: a
 * double-faced permanent's non-battlefield characteristics are always its front face (CR 712.8a),
 * so by the time this creature is in the graveyard it has already reverted to the Vincent
 * Valentine face, and a DFC re-entering the battlefield is front-face-up by default — the same
 * mechanism proven by Unstoppable Slasher's "return to the battlefield tapped" trigger.
