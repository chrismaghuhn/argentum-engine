/**
 * Elemental Teachings — {4}{G} Instant — Lesson (Avatar: The Last Airbender, rare).
 *
 * "Search your library for up to four land cards with different names and reveal them.
 *  An opponent chooses two of those cards. Put the chosen cards into your graveyard and
 *  the rest onto the battlefield tapped, then shuffle."
 *
 * Atomic pipeline (Tempt-with-Discovery shape with an opponent split):
 *  1. Gather library lands → controller `ChooseUpTo(4)` with `OnePerCardName` (different
 *     names) → "found". "Up to four" means the controller may find fewer (or none).
 *  2. Reveal "found".
 *  3. An opponent `ChooseExactly(2)` over "found" → "toGraveyard" / remainder "toBattlefield".
 *     The executor clamps the count to the collection size, so if fewer than two cards were
 *     found the opponent chooses that many (CR 700.x), and the rest still hit the battlefield.
 *  4. Move "toGraveyard" → graveyard, "toBattlefield" → battlefield tapped, then shuffle.
