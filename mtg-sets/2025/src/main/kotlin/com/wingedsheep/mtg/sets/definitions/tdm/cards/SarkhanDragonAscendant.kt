/**
 * Sarkhan, Dragon Ascendant — Tarkir: Dragonstorm #118
 * {1}{R} · Legendary Creature — Human Druid · 2/2 · Rare
 *
 * When Sarkhan enters, you may behold a Dragon. If you do, create a Treasure token.
 * (To behold a Dragon, choose a Dragon you control or reveal a Dragon card from your hand.)
 * Whenever a Dragon you control enters, put a +1/+1 counter on Sarkhan. Until end of turn,
 * Sarkhan becomes a Dragon in addition to its other types and gains flying.
 *
 * The ETB uses the resolution-time [Effects.Behold] effect ("you may behold a Dragon; if you do,
 * create a Treasure"). The second ability triggers on any Dragon you control entering
 * (`Triggers.a(filter).enters()` filtered to `Dragon` creatures you control, binding ANY): it adds
 * a +1/+1 counter to Sarkhan, then until end of turn makes him a Dragon in addition to his other
 * types ([AddCreatureTypeEffect] with [Duration.EndOfTurn]) and grants flying.
