/**
 * Summon: Brynhildr
 * {1}{R}
 * Enchantment Creature — Saga Knight
 * 2/1
 * (As this Saga enters and after your draw step, add a lore counter. Sacrifice after III.)
 * I — Chain — Exile the top card of your library. During any turn you put a lore counter on this
 *     Saga, you may play that card.
 * II, III — Gestalt Mode — When you next cast a creature spell this turn, it gains haste until end
 *     of turn.
 *
 * Chapter I ("Chain") is the impulse-exile shape: Gather top → Move to exile → grant a lasting "may
 * play from exile" permission ([MayPlayExpiry.Permanent], re-evaluated on every legal-action query
 * like Possibility Technician / Lightning, Security Sergeant). The oracle's window — "during any
 * turn you put a lore counter on this Saga" — is modeled as the gate "it's your turn AND you control
 * a Summon: Brynhildr": lore counters only land at enter and at your precombat main, so the turns a
 * counter is put on the Saga are exactly your turns while it's on the battlefield. The card isn't
 * legendary, so a name-filter [Exists] (rather than source identity) is the accepted corpus
 * approximation. The only divergences from the literal window are the theoretical proliferate-on-an-
 * opponent's-turn case and the sliver of turn III after the Saga is sacrificed (you can still play
 * the card during that same main phase before letting chapter III resolve).
 *
 * Chapters II and III ("Gestalt Mode") each install a one-shot end-of-turn delayed trigger on your
 * next creature spell cast — the same [CreateDelayedTriggerEffect] shape as Summon: Fenrir's chapter
 * II — whose effect grants haste to the triggering creature spell. The spell keeps its entity id as
 * it resolves onto the battlefield, so the haste grant (a floating keyword effect created while the
 * spell is on the stack) applies the moment it becomes a creature.
