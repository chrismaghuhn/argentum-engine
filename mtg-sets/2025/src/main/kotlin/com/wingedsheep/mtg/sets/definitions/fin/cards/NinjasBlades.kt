/**
 * Ninja's Blades
 * {2}{B}
 * Artifact — Equipment
 * Job select (When this Equipment enters, create a 1/1 colorless Hero creature token,
 *   then attach this to it.)
 * Equipped creature gets +1/+1, is a Ninja in addition to its other types, and has "Whenever
 *   this creature deals combat damage to a player, draw a card, then discard a card. That player
 *   loses life equal to the discarded card's mana value."
 * Mutsunokami — Equip {2}
 *
 * Standard Job-select Equipment shell ([jobSelect]) plus three grants on the equipped creature:
 * a flat [ModifyStats] bump, the Ninja type ([GrantSubtype]), and a granted combat-damage
 * trigger ([GrantTriggeredAbility] over the equipped-creature filter, so "this creature" /
 * [EffectTarget.Self] is the bearer and "you" / [EffectTarget.Controller] is its controller).
 *
 * The granted ability loots (draw 1, then discard 1 — [Patterns.Hand.discardCards] stores the
 * discarded card under the `discarded` collection), then the player dealt the combat damage
 * ([Player.TriggeringPlayer]) loses life equal to that card's mana value
 * ([DynamicAmount.StoredCardManaValue]). The discard is mandatory, so the looter holds at least
 * the freshly drawn card to pitch.
