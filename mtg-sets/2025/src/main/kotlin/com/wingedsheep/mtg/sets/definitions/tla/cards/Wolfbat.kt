/**
 * Wolfbat
 * {2}{B}
 * Creature — Wolf Bat
 * 2/2
 *
 * Flying
 * Whenever you draw your second card each turn, you may pay {B}. If you do, return this card
 * from your graveyard to the battlefield with a finality counter on it. (If a creature with a
 * finality counter on it would die, exile it instead.)
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 *  - The recursion ability fires from the graveyard via [triggerZone] = [Zone.GRAVEYARD], the same
 *    shape as Invasion's Pyre Zombie.
 *  - "your second card each turn" is `Triggers.<player>.drawsNth(n)` (n = 2, Player.You).
 *  - "you may pay {B}. If you do, ..." is a [Effects.MayPay]; the payoff returns this card from
 *    the graveyard to the battlefield ([EffectTarget.Self]) and stamps a finality counter on it
 *    via [AddCountersEffect] / [CounterType.FINALITY] (death replacement handled engine-side).
