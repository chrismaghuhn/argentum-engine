/**
 * Hog-Monkey
 * {2}{B}
 * Creature — Boar Monkey
 * 3/2
 *
 * At the beginning of combat on your turn, target creature you control with a +1/+1 counter on it
 * gains menace until end of turn.
 * Exhaust — {5}: Put two +1/+1 counters on this creature. (Activate each exhaust ability only once.)
 *
 * The begin-combat trigger targets a creature you control carrying a +1/+1 counter (so it pairs with
 * the exhaust ability, which puts counters on Hog-Monkey itself) and grants menace until end of turn.
 * The exhaust ability is the set's once-per-object activated ability — `isExhaust = true` renders the
 * "Exhaust — " prefix and desugars to `ActivationRestriction.Once`.
