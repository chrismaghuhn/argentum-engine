/**
 * Ride the Shoopuf — Final Fantasy #197
 * {1}{G} · Enchantment · Uncommon
 *
 * Landfall — Whenever a land you control enters, put a +1/+1 counter on target creature you control.
 * {5}{G}{G}: This enchantment becomes a 7/7 Beast creature in addition to its other types.
 *
 * The landfall trigger uses `Triggers.a(GameObjectFilter.Land.youControl()).enters()` (fires for any land you control entering,
 * not just lands you play) and targets a creature you control via [TargetFilter.CreatureYouControl].
 *
 * The animation is a permanent [Effects.BecomeCreature] on the source: it adds the CREATURE type
 * (no `removeTypes`, so "in addition to its other types" — it stays an Enchantment), sets base 7/7,
 * and adds the Beast subtype. `duration = Duration.Permanent` — the ability has no duration, so it
 * remains a creature indefinitely (mirrors Emergent Haunting).
