/**
 * Summon: Primal Odin
 * {4}{B}{B}
 * Enchantment Creature — Saga Knight
 * 5/3
 * (As this Saga enters and after your draw step, add a lore counter. Sacrifice after III.)
 * I — Gungnir — Destroy target creature an opponent controls.
 * II — Zantetsuken — This creature gains "Whenever this creature deals combat damage to a player,
 *   that player loses the game."
 * III — Hall of Sorrow — Draw two cards. Each player loses 2 life.
 *
 * Three-chapter Saga (sacrifice after III; derived from the highest declared chapter). Chapter II
 * permanently grants the Saga creature itself the Phage-style "deals combat damage to a player →
 * that player loses the game" trigger via [GrantTriggeredAbilityEffect] (SELF, [Duration.Permanent]),
 * reusing `Triggers.self.dealsCombatDamage(Recipient.AnyPlayer)` + [Effects.LoseGame] on the damaged player. Chapter
 * III draws two and drains every player for 2 ([Player.Each]).
