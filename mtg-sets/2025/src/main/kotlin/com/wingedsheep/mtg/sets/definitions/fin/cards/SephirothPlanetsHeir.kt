/**
 * Sephiroth, Planet's Heir
 * {4}{U}{B}
 * Legendary Creature — Human Avatar Soldier
 * 4/4
 * Vigilance
 * When Sephiroth enters, creatures your opponents control get -2/-2 until end of turn.
 * Whenever a creature an opponent controls dies, put a +1/+1 counter on Sephiroth.
 *
 * The enters debuff applies a per-creature -2/-2 floating effect to every creature an
 * opponent controls at resolution ([Effects.ForEachInGroup] over [GroupFilter], with the
 * iterated creature as [EffectTarget.IterationEntity]); creatures that enter later are unaffected, as
 * the affected set is fixed when the ability resolves. The death trigger is a
 * `Triggers.<subject>.leaves(to, excludeTo, excludeSacrifice)` to the graveyard, filtered to opponent-controlled creatures
 * with [TriggerBinding.ANY].
