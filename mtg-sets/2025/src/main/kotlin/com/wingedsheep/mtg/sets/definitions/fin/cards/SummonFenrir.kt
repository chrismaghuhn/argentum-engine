/**
 * Summon: Fenrir
 * {2}{G}
 * Enchantment Creature — Saga Wolf
 * 3/2
 * (As this Saga enters and after your draw step, add a lore counter. Sacrifice after III.)
 * I — Crescent Fang — Search your library for a basic land card, put it onto the battlefield
 *     tapped, then shuffle.
 * II — Heavenward Howl — When you next cast a creature spell this turn, that creature enters
 *     with an additional +1/+1 counter on it.
 * III — Ecliptic Growl — Draw a card if you control the creature with the greatest power or
 *     tied for the greatest power.
 *
 * Chapter II installs a one-shot, end-of-turn delayed triggered ability whose
 * `SpellCastEvent` filter matches any creature spell you cast. When the next such spell is
 * cast that turn, the trigger adds a +1/+1 counter to the spell on the stack via
 * `EffectTarget.TriggeringEntity`; the counter travels with the spell to the battlefield as
 * it resolves, satisfying "enters with an additional +1/+1 counter on it" naturally. Same
 * primitive as Long List of the Ents, minus the noted-type filter (here it's any creature).
 *
 * Chapter III's "you control the creature with the greatest power or tied for the greatest
 * power" ≡ you control a creature AND your max creature-power >= the global max
 * creature-power. The `ControlCreature` conjunct excludes the 0-vs-0 case when no creatures
 * exist (same condition shape as Thickest in the Thicket).
