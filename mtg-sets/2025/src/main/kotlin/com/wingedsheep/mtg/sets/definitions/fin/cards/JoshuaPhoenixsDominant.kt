/**
 * Joshua, Phoenix's Dominant // Phoenix, Warden of Fire — Final Fantasy #229
 * {1}{R}{W} · Legendary Creature — Human Noble Wizard 3/4
 * // Legendary Enchantment Creature — Saga Phoenix 4/4
 *
 * Front — Joshua, Phoenix's Dominant:
 *   When Joshua enters, discard up to two cards, then draw that many cards.
 *   {3}{R}{W}, {T}: Exile Joshua, then return it to the battlefield transformed under its
 *   owner's control. Activate only as a sorcery.
 *
 * Back — Phoenix, Warden of Fire (eikon Saga):
 *   (As this Saga enters and after your draw step, add a lore counter.)
 *   I, II — Rising Flames — Phoenix deals 2 damage to each opponent.
 *   III — Flames of Rebirth — Return any number of target creature cards with total mana
 *   value 6 or less from your graveyard to the battlefield. Exile Phoenix, then return it to
 *   the battlefield (front face up).
 *   Flying, lifelink
 *
 * The ETB loot is the Sokka idiom: gather hand → choose up to two to discard → draw the
 * discarded `_count` (declining discards draws zero, per the 2025-06-06 ruling). The Dominant
 * transform loop follows Dion, Bahamut's Dominant — an [Effects.ExileAndReturnTransformed]
 * on the front's sorcery-speed activated ability and again (with [ReturnFace.FRONT]) at the
 * eikon's final chapter. Note the Saga has no "Sacrifice after III" clause: chapter III
 * flips it back to the front face rather than sacrificing it. Flames of Rebirth
 * targets: the chapter ability chooses any number of creature cards in your graveyard as it
 * goes on the stack (CR 603.3d), their summed mana value capped at 6 by
 * [TargetObject.totalManaValueAtMost], and returns whichever are still there on resolution.
 * Rising Flames'
 * damage feeds the back face's lifelink automatically.
