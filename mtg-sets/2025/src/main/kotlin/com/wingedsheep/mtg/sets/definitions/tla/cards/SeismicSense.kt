/**
 * Seismic Sense — {G} Sorcery — Lesson
 *
 * Look at the top X cards of your library, where X is the number of lands you control.
 * You may reveal a creature or land card from among them and put it into your hand.
 * Put the rest on the bottom of your library in a random order.
 *
 * X is computed at resolution from the number of lands you control. The "may reveal …
 * put it into your hand" clause is modelled as an optional (ChooseUpTo 1) selection over
 * the looked-at cards filtered to creature-or-land; declining keeps every card in the
 * remainder, which is bottomed in a random order.
