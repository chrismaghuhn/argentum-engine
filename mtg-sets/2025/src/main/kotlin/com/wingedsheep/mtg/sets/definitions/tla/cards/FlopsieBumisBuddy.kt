/**
 * Flopsie, Bumi's Buddy
 * {4}{G}{G}
 * Legendary Creature — Ape Goat
 * 4/4
 *
 * When Flopsie enters, put a +1/+1 counter on each creature you control.
 * Each creature you control with power 4 or greater can't be blocked by more than one creature.
 *
 * The ETB iterates every creature the controller has ([Effects.ForEachInGroup] over
 * [GameObjectFilter.Creature.youControl]) and drops one +1/+1 counter on each — Flopsie itself
 * included, since it is on the battlefield as the trigger resolves (mirrors The Crystal's Chosen).
 *
 * The blocking restriction is a static ability ([CantBeBlockedByMoreThan] with maxBlockers = 1)
 * scoped by a group filter to creatures you control with power 4 or greater. Combat blocker
 * validation reads projected power, so a creature dipping below 4 (or losing control) drops out of
 * the restriction automatically (mirrors Rocksteady, Crash Courser's filtered variant).
