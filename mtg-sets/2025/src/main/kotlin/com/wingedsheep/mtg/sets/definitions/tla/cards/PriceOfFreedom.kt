/**
 * Price of Freedom — {1}{R} Sorcery — Lesson
 *
 * Destroy target artifact or land an opponent controls. Its controller may search
 * their library for a basic land card, put it onto the battlefield tapped, then * shuffle.
 * Draw a card.
 *
 * Same Path-to-Exile-style compensation shape as [com.wingedsheep.mtg.sets.definitions.fin.cards.Sandworm]:
 * the destroy resolves first, then the destroyed permanent's controller — not the caster —
 * gets the optional basic-land search, so the [Effects.May] gate and the search pipeline are
 * delegated to [EffectTarget.TargetController] / [Player.ControllerOf]. "Its controller"
 * resolves from the targeted permanent at resolution; since it has just left the battlefield,
 * it falls back to its owner (last-known controller for a permanent that left play). Finally
 * the caster draws a card.
