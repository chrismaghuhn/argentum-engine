/**
 * Earthbending Lesson — {3}{G} Sorcery — Lesson
 *
 * Earthbend 4. (Target land you control becomes a 0/0 creature with haste that's
 * still a land. Put four +1/+1 counters on it. When it dies or is exiled, return
 * it to the battlefield tapped.)
 *
 * Earthbend is a keyword *action* (CR 701-style), not a keyword ability — there is
 * no `keywordAbility(...)` on the spell. The behavior is composed entirely from
 * existing primitives via [Effects.Earthbend]: animate, grant haste, add counters,
 * and grant two self-triggers (return-from-graveyard, return-from-exile).
