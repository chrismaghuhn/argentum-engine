/**
 * Sun Warriors — {2}{R}{W}
 * Creature — Human Warrior Ally
 * 3/5
 * Firebending X, where X is the number of creatures you control. (Whenever this creature
 * attacks, add X {R}. This mana lasts until end of combat.)
 * {5}: Create a 1/1 white Ally creature token.
 *
 * Firebending here is *dynamic* — X is computed on attack — so it can't use the fixed
 * `firebending(n)` helper. Instead the "Firebending X" keyword tag is shown via
 * [KeywordAbility.Variable] and the behaviour is hand-wired as an attack-triggered
 * [AddManaEffect] producing X red mana ([DynamicAmounts.creaturesYouControl]) with
 * [ManaExpiry.END_OF_COMBAT] — exactly how the `firebending` DSL models the fixed case.
