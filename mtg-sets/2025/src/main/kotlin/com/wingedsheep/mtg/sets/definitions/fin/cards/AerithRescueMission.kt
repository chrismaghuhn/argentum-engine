/**
 * Aerith Rescue Mission
 * {3}{W}
 * Sorcery
 * Choose one —
 * • Take the Elevator — Create three 1/1 colorless Hero creature tokens.
 * • Take 59 Flights of Stairs — Tap up to three target creatures. Put a stun counter on
 *   one of them. (If a permanent with a stun counter would become untapped, remove one from
 *   it instead.)
 *
 * Mode A creates three 1/1 colorless Hero tokens via a single [Effects.CreateToken]
 * (count = 3, the Job-select Hero token shared across this set — same token image URI as
 * Dwarven Castle Guard / White Mage's Staff et al.).
 *
 * Mode B is a single "up to three target creatures" requirement
 * (`TargetCreature(count = 3, optional = true)`) — those targets are locked at cast time, then
 * at resolution:
 *   1. [Effects.TapEachTarget] taps every chosen target.
 *   2. [GatherCardsEffect] from [CardSource.ChosenTargets] collects exactly those tapped
 *      creatures (the mode's `EffectContext.targets`).
 *   3. [SelectFromCollectionEffect] (`ChooseExactly(1)`, controller-chosen) honors the ruling
 *      that the controller picks *which* of the tapped creatures gets the stun, and that the
 *      choice is made at resolution — not at cast time. If zero creatures were targeted (the
 *      "up to" lower bound), the gather is empty and the selection is a silent no-op.
 *   4. [AddCountersToCollectionEffect] places the single stun counter on the chosen creature.
 *
 * This is the faithful "act on N targets, then a player-chosen sub-choice among them at
 * resolution" shape — composed entirely from existing pipeline primitives (cf. Bolster /
 * Blight in `MechanicPatterns`), so no determinism shortcut is taken.
