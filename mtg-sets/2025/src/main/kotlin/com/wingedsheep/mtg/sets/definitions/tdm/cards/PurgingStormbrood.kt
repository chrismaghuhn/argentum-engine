 * Purging Stormbrood // Absorb Essence — Tarkir: Dragonstorm #213
 * {4}{B} · Creature — Dragon · 4/4
 *
 * Flying
 * Ward—Pay 2 life.
 * When this creature enters, remove all counters from up to one target creature.
 *
 * Omen: Absorb Essence — {1}{W}, Instant — Omen
 * Target creature gets +2/+2 and gains lifelink and hexproof until end of turn.

 * (Omen, Tarkir: Dragonstorm: casting the Omen face shuffles this card into its owner's
 * library on resolution instead of putting it in the graveyard. From every zone other than
 * the stack the card is just the Dragon — see [com.wingedsheep.sdk.model.CardLayout.OMEN].)
