/**
 * Master Piandao
 * {4}{W}
 * Legendary Creature — Human Warrior Ally
 * 4/4
 *
 * First strike
 * Whenever Master Piandao attacks, look at the top four cards of your library. You may reveal
 * an Ally, Equipment, or Lesson card from among them and put it into your hand. Put the rest on
 * the bottom of your library in a random order.
 *
 * The attack trigger reuses the shared [Patterns.Library.lookAtTopRevealMatchingToHand] recipe
 * (Guru Pathik shape): dig four, optionally reveal one card matching the subtype predicate to
 * hand, then bottom the remainder in a random order. "Ally, Equipment, or Lesson" is a
 * type-agnostic subtype union via [GameObjectFilter.Any.withAnySubtype], since the three subtypes
 * span creatures, artifacts, and enchantments/sorceries respectively.
