/**
 * Cloud, Midgar Mercenary
 * {W}{W}
 * Legendary Creature — Human Soldier Mercenary
 * 2/1
 * When Cloud enters, search your library for an Equipment card, reveal it, put it into your hand,
 * then shuffle.
 * As long as Cloud is equipped, if a triggered ability of Cloud or an Equipment attached to it
 * triggers, that ability triggers an additional time.
 *
 * The doubling reuses [AdditionalSourceTriggers], extended for this card with:
 *  - `alsoSource = true` — Cloud's *own* triggered abilities are doubled ("a triggered ability of
 *    Cloud or …"), independently of the filter that catches its Equipment.
 *  - a `condition` gate — [Conditions.SourceMatches] over `equipped()` ("As long as Cloud is
 *    equipped, …"); when nothing is attached the whole ability is inert.
 * The filter `Artifact.withSubtype("Equipment").attachedToSource()` catches the triggers of any
 * Equipment currently attached to Cloud. Per the ruling this doesn't copy the ability — it makes it
 * trigger one extra time, with choices made independently for each instance.
