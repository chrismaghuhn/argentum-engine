/**
 * Earth Rumble
 * {3}{G}
 * Sorcery
 *
 * Earthbend 2. When you do, up to one target creature you control fights target
 * creature an opponent controls. (To earthbend 2, target land you control becomes a
 * 0/0 creature with haste that's still a land. Put two +1/+1 counters on it. When it
 * dies or is exiled, return it to the battlefield tapped. Creatures that fight each
 * deal damage equal to their power to the other.)
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *  - Earthbend is a keyword *action* composed from primitives via [Effects.Earthbend]
 *    (animate the target land, grant haste, add two +1/+1 counters, grant the
 *    return-tapped self-trigger) — same as Rockalanche / Earthbender Ascension. Its land
 *    is a true target chosen as the sorcery is cast.
 *  - "When you do" is the reflexive trigger off the (mandatory) earthbend action, modeled
 *    with [ReflexiveTriggerEffect] (`optional = false`): the earthbend resolves first, then
 *    the fight goes on the stack with its own targets chosen at that point (SandbenderScavengers
 *    / Gimli shape). "up to one target creature you control" is the optional first reflexive
 *    target; "target creature an opponent controls" is the mandatory second. A symmetric
 *    [Effects.Fight] reads them as `ContextTarget(0)`/`ContextTarget(1)`; if the optional
 *    fighter is declined, no creature is dealt damage.
