/**
 * Swallowed by Leviathan

 * Instant

 * Choose target spell. Surveil 2, then counter the chosen spell unless its controller pays
 * {1} for each card in your graveyard.
 *
 * Pure composition over existing effects, ordered to match the printed sequence:
 *  1. [Effects.Surveil]`(2)` — resolves *first*, so any cards milled into your graveyard
 *     count toward the tax below (the card is intentionally a "fill your own graveyard to
 *     raise the price" spell).
 *  2. [Effects.CounterUnlessDynamicPays] with [DynamicAmount.Count] over your graveyard —
 *     "{1} for each card in your graveyard", evaluated when this step runs (post-surveil).
 *     Swallowed by Leviathan and the chosen spell are still on the stack, so neither is
 *     counted.
