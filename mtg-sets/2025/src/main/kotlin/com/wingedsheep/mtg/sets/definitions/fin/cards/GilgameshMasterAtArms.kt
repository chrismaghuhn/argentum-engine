/**
 * Gilgamesh, Master-at-Arms
 * {4}{R}{R}
 * Legendary Creature — Human Samurai
 * 6/6
 * Whenever Gilgamesh enters or attacks, look at the top six cards of your library. You may put
 *   any number of Equipment cards from among them onto the battlefield. Put the rest on the
 *   bottom of your library in a random order. When you put one or more Equipment onto the
 *   battlefield this way, you may attach one of them to a Samurai you control.
 *
 * "Enters or attacks" is the Frodo, Determined Hero shape: two sibling triggered abilities (the
 * engine has no combined enters-or-attacks trigger) sharing one [lookAtTopSixPutEquipment] body.
 *
 * The body is a Gather → Select(any number, filtered to Equipment) → Move(battlefield) /
 * Move(bottom, random) pipeline — the [com.wingedsheep.sdk.dsl.LibraryPatterns.lookAtTopAndKeep]
 * shape, but with a filtered any-number selection (only Equipment cards are eligible — the rest
 * of the six aren't offered) and a battlefield destination instead of hand/graveyard, matching
 * the Beatrix, Loyal General / Colossus of the Blood Age inline-pipeline idiom for "any number"
 * resolution-time choices that aren't `target`ed.
 *
 * "When you put one or more Equipment onto the battlefield this way, you may attach one of them
 * to a Samurai you control" has neither half ("one of them" / "a Samurai you control") marked
 * `target` in the oracle text, so both are resolution-time choices, not cast/trigger-time
 * targets. It's gated by an `ifNotEmpty` branch on the battlefield-bound collection so it
 * only runs when at least one Equipment was actually put onto the battlefield, then composes two
 * `chooseUpTo(1)` picks (which equipment / which Samurai — `chooseUpTo` already covers "you may"
 * by allowing zero) feeding [Effects.AttachTargetEquipmentToCreature], which no-ops gracefully if
 * either resolves to nothing (no Samurai you control, or the player declines).
 *
 * Per Scryfall ruling (2025-06-06) this "When you put..." sentence is technically a *reflexive*
 * triggered ability that goes on the stack as its own object — relevant because Job select
 * Equipment (e.g. Samurai's Katana) has its own "when this Equipment enters" trigger, and the two
 * would fire simultaneously, with the controller choosing stack order. The engine has no general
 * primitive for spawning a brand-new stack object mid-resolution that interleaves with ordinary
 * simultaneous triggers (`CreateDelayedTriggerEffect` is built for future-step/future-event
 * delayed triggers, not an immediate same-batch reflexive trigger; building that generically is
 * `add-feature` scope, not a single-card change). This card models the reflexive sentence as an
 * inline pipeline continuation instead, mirroring the same simplification already accepted for
 * Weapons Vendor's "you may pay {1}. When you do, attach target Equipment..." in this set. Per
 * the same ruling, the final board state is identical regardless of which order the two abilities
 * would have been stacked in — Job select always re-attaches the Equipment to its own Hero token
 * afterward — so the only rules nuance lost is a narrow instant-speed response window between the
 * two would-be stack objects, not any observable outcome.
