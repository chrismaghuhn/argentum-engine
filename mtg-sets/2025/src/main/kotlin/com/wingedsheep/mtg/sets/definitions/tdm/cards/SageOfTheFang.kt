/**
 * Sage of the Fang — Tarkir: Dragonstorm #155
 * {2}{G} · Creature — Human Druid · 2/2
 *
 * When this creature enters, put a +1/+1 counter on target creature.
 * Renew — {3}{G}, Exile this card from your graveyard: Put a +1/+1 counter on target creature,
 * then double the number of +1/+1 counters on that creature. Activate only as a sorcery.
 *
 * ETB is a plain [Effects.AddCounters]. The Renew ability adds one +1/+1 counter and then
 * doubles the resulting total via [Effects.DoubleCounters] (reads the post-add count, so the
 * creature ends with 2×(existing+1) counters). Both target the same creature; the doubling
 * runs on the same [Targets.Creature] reference, so "that creature" resolves to the one that
 * received the new counter.
