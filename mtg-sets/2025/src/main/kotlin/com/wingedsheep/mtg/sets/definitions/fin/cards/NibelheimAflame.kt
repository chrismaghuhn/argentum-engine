/**
 * Nibelheim Aflame

 *
 * Choose target creature you control. It deals damage equal to its power to each other creature.
 * If this spell was cast from a graveyard, discard your hand and draw four cards.
 * Flashback {5}{R}{R}
 *
 * The chosen creature deals damage equal to its power to each OTHER creature: a
 * [Effects.ForEachInGroup] over every creature except the chosen one
 * (`GroupFilter(...).otherThanTarget()`), each iterated creature ([EffectTarget.IterationEntity]) taking
 * [DynamicAmounts.targetPower] damage *from the chosen creature itself* (`damageSource = chosen`),
 * so its combat keywords and "dealt damage by" triggers see the correct source. The graveyard-cast
 * rider is a [Effects.If] gated on [Conditions.WasCastFromGraveyard] — true when the
 * flashback cast resolves.
