/**
 * Unexpected Request
 * {2}{R}
 * Sorcery
 * Gain control of target creature until end of turn. Untap that creature. It gains haste until end
 *   of turn. You may attach an Equipment you control to that creature. If you do, unattach it at the
 *   beginning of the next end step.
 *
 * A "threaten" with an optional Equipment rider, composed from existing primitives (no monolithic
 * executor):
 *  - [Effects.GainControl] of the target creature for [Duration.EndOfTurn], then [Effects.Untap]
 *    and a [Duration.EndOfTurn] haste grant — the standard borrow-and-swing package.
 *  - The Equipment to move is an *optional* second target (you may decline by choosing none). A
 *    [Effects.If] gates the attach on an Equipment actually having been chosen
 *    ([Conditions.EntityMatches] resolves to `false` when the optional slot is empty), so the "if
 *    you do" clause is honored — no attach, no scheduled unattach when you decline.
 *  - When an Equipment is chosen, [Effects.AttachTargetEquipmentToCreature] moves it onto the
 *    borrowed creature and a [CreateDelayedTriggerEffect] at [Step.END] unattaches it at the
 *    beginning of the next end step. The Equipment never changes controller, so it remains yours
 *    when the borrowed creature reverts at cleanup.
