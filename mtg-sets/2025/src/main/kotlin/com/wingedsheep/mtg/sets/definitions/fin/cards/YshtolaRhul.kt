/**
 * Y'shtola Rhul
 * {4}{U}{U}
 * Legendary Creature — Cat Druid
 * 3/5
 *
 * At the beginning of your end step, exile target creature you control, then return it to the
 * battlefield under its owner's control. Then if it's the first end step of the turn, there is an
 * additional end step after this step.
 *
 * The blink is the standard immediate exile-then-return ([Effects.Move] to exile, then back to the
 * battlefield — cards return under their owner's control by default). The "additional end step"
 * rider is gated behind [Conditions.IsFirstEndStepOfTurn] (CR 500.9 / 513): the trigger fires again
 * during the extra end step it creates, but by then the active player is flagged as being in an
 * inserted end step, so the condition is false and no further end step is spawned — exactly one
 * extra end step per turn.
