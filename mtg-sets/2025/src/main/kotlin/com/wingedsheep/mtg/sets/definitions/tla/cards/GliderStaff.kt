/**
 * Glider Staff — {2}{W} Artifact — Equipment
 *
 * When this Equipment enters, airbend up to one target creature. (Exile it. While it's exiled,
 * its owner may cast it for {2} rather than its mana cost.)
 * Equipped creature gets +1/+1 and has flying.
 * Equip {2}
 *
 * The ETB airbend uses the target-agnostic [Effects.Airbend] (it airbends the trigger's chosen
 * target via `CardSource.ChosenTargets`); the "up to one" optionality lives on the target
 * requirement. The +1/+1 and flying are two equipment statics over [Filters.EquippedCreature].
