/**
 * Starry-Eyed Skyrider — Tarkir: Dragonstorm #25
 * {2}{W} · Creature — Human Scout · 1/3
 *
 * Flying
 * Whenever this creature attacks, another target creature you control gains flying until end of turn.
 * Attacking tokens you control have flying.
 *
 * The attack trigger grants flying to a single other creature you control via [Effects.GrantKeyword]
 * (until end of turn). The third line is a continuous static [GrantKeyword] over the group of
 * attacking tokens you control — composed from [GameObjectFilter.Token] + `.youControl()` +
 * `.attacking()`, so the flying is granted/removed dynamically by projected state as tokens enter or
 * leave combat (and lost immediately if Skyrider leaves the battlefield).
