/**
 * Ultima
 * {3}{W}{W}
 * Sorcery
 * Destroy all artifacts and creatures. End the turn.
 *
 * The board wipe resolves first — regeneration still saves creatures (there is no "can't be
 * regenerated" clause). Then "end the turn" (CR 724.1): all spells and abilities on the stack are
 * exiled, including Ultima itself and the dies triggers from the wipe (even those that can't be
 * countered — they never reach the stack, CR 724.1a); creatures are removed from combat; and the
 * game skips straight to the cleanup step — the active player discards down to their maximum hand
 * size, marked damage wears off, and "this turn" / "until end of turn" effects end — before the
 * next turn begins.
