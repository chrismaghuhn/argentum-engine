/**
 * Crashing Wave

 * As an additional cost to cast this spell, waterbend {X}.
 * Tap up to X target creatures, then distribute three stun counters among any number of tapped
 * creatures your opponents control.
 *
 * X comes from the waterbend {X} cost (`waterbendCost(isX = true)`): the chosen X bounds the
 * targeting (`dynamicMaxCount = DynamicAmount.XValue`) and is the waterbend amount paid by tapping
 * artifacts/creatures. Resolution: tap the up-to-X target creatures, then distribute three stun
 * counters among the tapped creatures opponents control (resolved at that point, so it includes any
 * just tapped) — `minPerTarget = 0`, so all three may pile onto one.
