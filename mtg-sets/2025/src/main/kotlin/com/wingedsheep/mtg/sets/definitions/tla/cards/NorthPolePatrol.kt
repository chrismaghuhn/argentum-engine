/**
 * North Pole Patrol
 * {2}{U}
 * Creature — Human Soldier Ally
 * 2/3
 * {T}: Untap another target permanent you control.
 * Waterbend {3}, {T}: Tap target creature an opponent controls. (While paying a waterbend cost,
 *   you can tap your artifacts and creatures to help. Each one pays for {1}.)
 *
 * Both abilities reuse existing primitives: the untap is a plain targeted [Effects.Untap]; the
 * waterbend ability is a `Costs.Composite(Mana, Tap)` carrying `hasWaterbend = true`, so the engine
 * extracts the {3} generic and lets the player tap their artifacts/creatures to help pay it while the
 * Patrol's own tap is consumed by the activation cost.
