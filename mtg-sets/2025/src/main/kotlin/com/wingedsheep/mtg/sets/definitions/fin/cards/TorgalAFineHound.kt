/**
 * Torgal, A Fine Hound
 * {1}{G}
 * Legendary Creature — Wolf
 * 2/2
 *
 * Whenever you cast your first Human creature spell each turn, that creature enters with an
 * additional +1/+1 counter on it for each Dog and/or Wolf you control.
 * {T}: Add one mana of any color.
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 *  - "your first Human creature spell each turn" = a `Triggers.you.casts(spell, requires)` trigger filtered to
 *    Human creature spells (`GameObjectFilter.Creature.withSubtype("Human")`) with
 *    `oncePerTurn = true`, so it fires on the first such spell you cast each turn and not again.
 *  - The counter is placed on the triggering spell while it is still on the stack
 *    ([EffectTarget.TriggeringEntity]); it travels with the spell to the battlefield as it
 *    resolves, satisfying "that creature enters with an additional +1/+1 counter on it"
 *    naturally — the same primitive Summon: Fenrir's chapter II uses, here with a dynamic count.
 *  - "for each Dog and/or Wolf you control" is a dynamic amount counting permanents you control
 *    that are Dogs or Wolves (`withAnySubtype("Dog", "Wolf")`, OR logic). Counting zero is fine —
 *    the spell still resolves; it just enters with no extra counters. (Torgal himself is a Wolf,
 *    so unless he has left the battlefield the count is at least 1.)
 *  - "{T}: Add one mana of any color" is a standard mana ability (`manaAbility = true`).
