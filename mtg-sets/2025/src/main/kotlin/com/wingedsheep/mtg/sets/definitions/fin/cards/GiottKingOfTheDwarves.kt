/**
 * Giott, King of the Dwarves
 * {R}{W}
 * Legendary Creature — Dwarf Noble
 * 1/1
 * Double strike
 * Whenever Giott or another Dwarf you control enters and whenever an Equipment you control enters,
 * you may discard a card. If you do, draw a card.
 *
 * The printed ability triggers on two distinct events ("whenever X and whenever Y"); modeled as two
 * triggered abilities sharing the same rummage payoff. The Dwarf trigger uses [TriggerBinding.ANY]
 * with a "Dwarf you control" filter so it also fires when Giott itself enters.
