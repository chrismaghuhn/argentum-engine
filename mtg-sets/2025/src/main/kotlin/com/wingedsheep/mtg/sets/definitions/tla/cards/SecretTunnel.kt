/**
 * Secret Tunnel
 * Land — Cave
 *
 * This land can't be blocked.
 * {T}: Add {C}.
 * {4}, {T}: Two target creatures you control that share a creature type can't be blocked this turn.
 *
 * The static "can't be blocked" is a printed [CantBeBlocked] on the land itself — harmless while the
 * land isn't a creature, but honored if it's ever animated. The activated ability uses a single
 * two-target requirement with [TargetObject.sameCreatureType] (count = 2), so the two chosen
 * creatures you control must share at least one (projected) creature type with each other — the
 * cross-target legality is enforced by `TargetValidator`. [ForEachTargetEffect] then rebinds
 * `ContextTarget(0)` to each chosen creature in turn and grants it "can't be blocked" until end of
 * turn via [GrantKeywordEffect] (the IcyBlast idiom — see the inline note on why a single
 * `GrantStaticAbility` over the two targets does not iterate correctly here).
