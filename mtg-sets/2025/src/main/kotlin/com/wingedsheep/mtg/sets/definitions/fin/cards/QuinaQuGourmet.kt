/**
 * Quina, Qu Gourmet

 * Legendary Creature — Qu
 * 2/3
 *
 * If one or more tokens would be created under your control, those tokens plus a
 * 1/1 green Frog creature token are created instead.
 * {2}, Sacrifice a Frog: Put a +1/+1 counter on Quina.
 *
 * The token-creation clause is a replacement effect (CR 614) that fires once per
 * token-creation event under your control, regardless of how many or what kind of
 * tokens the event makes (Scryfall rulings 2025-06-06: you must be the one creating
 * the tokens, but you needn't control the source). It is self-limiting (CR 614.5):
 * the added Frog is created directly and does not itself re-enter the replacement
 * pipeline, so it never recurses on its own Frog. The added Frog also gains none of
 * the original tokens' abilities (ruling), though it does inherit the original
 * creation's "tapped" rider via [CreateAdditionalToken.inheritTapped].
