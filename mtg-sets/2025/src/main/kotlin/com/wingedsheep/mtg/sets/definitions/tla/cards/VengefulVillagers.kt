/**
 * Vengeful Villagers
 * {3}{W}
 * Creature — Human Citizen
 * 3/3
 *
 * Whenever this creature attacks, choose target creature an opponent controls. Tap it, then
 * you may sacrifice an artifact or creature. If you do, put a stun counter on the chosen
 * creature. (If a permanent with a stun counter would become untapped, remove one from it
 * instead.)
 *
 * Attack trigger that targets an opponent's creature, taps it, then offers an optional
 * resolution-time sacrifice. The sacrifice is modeled with `Effects.MayPay`
 * (`Gate.MayPay`) so declining (or having nothing to sacrifice) skips the stun counter —
 * matching the "you may … if you do" wording.
