/**
 * Rediscover the Way — Tarkir: Dragonstorm #215
 * {U}{R}{W} · Enchantment — Saga · Rare
 *
 * (As this Saga enters and after your draw step, add a lore counter. Sacrifice after III.)
 * I, II — Look at the top three cards of your library. Put one of them into your hand and the
 *         rest on the bottom of your library in any order.
 * III — Whenever you cast a noncreature spell this turn, target creature you control gains
 *       double strike until end of turn.
 *
 * Chapters I and II are the standard "look at top three, keep one to hand, bottom the rest in any
 * order" dig — [Patterns.Library.lookAtTopAndKeep] with the remainder going to the bottom of the
 * library, ordered by the controller ([CardOrder.ControllerChooses]).
 *
 * Chapter III installs a turn-bounded, event-based delayed triggered ability:
 * [CreateDelayedTriggerEffect] on `Triggers.you.casts(GameObjectFilter.Noncreature)` with `fireOnce = false` (it fires
 * for *every* noncreature spell cast this turn, not just the first) and `expiry = EndOfTurn`. Its
 * [CreateDelayedTriggerEffect.targetRequirement] is "target creature you control", chosen each
 * time the trigger fires; the chosen creature is granted double strike until end of turn via
 * [Effects.GrantKeyword] reading `ContextTarget(0)`.
