/**
 * From Father to Son
 * {1}{W}
 * Sorcery
 * Search your library for a Vehicle card, reveal it, and put it into your hand. If this spell
 *   was cast from a graveyard, put that card onto the battlefield instead. Then shuffle.
 * Flashback {4}{W}{W}{W}
 *
 * A Gather → Select → Move tutor whose *destination* is chosen at resolution by where the spell
 * was cast from. The only flashback-legal way to cast this from the graveyard is its own
 * flashback cost, so [WasCastFromZone] (GRAVEYARD) cleanly distinguishes the two printed
 * destinations: the found card goes to the battlefield on a graveyard cast, otherwise to hand.
 * Both branches reveal the card (the move's `revealed` flag) and the shuffle happens after,
 * matching "Then shuffle." "Search for ... a card" is a may-find tutor, so the selection is
 * [SelectionMode.ChooseUpTo] 1 (you may fail to find).
