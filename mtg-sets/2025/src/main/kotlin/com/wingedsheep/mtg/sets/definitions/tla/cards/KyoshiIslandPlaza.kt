/**
 * Kyoshi Island Plaza
 * {3}{G}
 * Legendary Enchantment — Shrine
 * When Kyoshi Island Plaza enters, search your library for up to X basic land cards, where X is
 * the number of Shrines you control. Put those cards onto the battlefield tapped, then shuffle.
 * Whenever another Shrine you control enters, search your library for a basic land card, put it
 * onto the battlefield tapped, then shuffle.
 *
 * Parallels the Shrine cycle (cf. The Spirit Oasis, Northern Air Temple): the ETB fetches up to
 * one basic land per Shrine you control (this permanent counts itself, as it is already on the
 * battlefield when the trigger resolves), and a second trigger fetches one basic land on every
 * *other* Shrine you control entering ([TriggerBinding.OTHER] so Kyoshi Island Plaza's own entry
 * doesn't fire the second ability).
