/**
 * Kain, Traitorous Dragoon
 * {2}{B}
 * Legendary Creature — Human Knight
 * 2/4
 *
 * Jump — During your turn, Kain has flying.
 * Whenever Kain deals combat damage to a player, that player gains control of Kain. If they do,
 * you draw that many cards, create that many tapped Treasure tokens, then lose that much life.
 *
 * "Jump" is modelled as a conditional static ability (Rule 604): while it's your turn, Kain grants
 * itself flying via [GroupFilter.source]. The rest of the time it has no evasion, so it can be blocked.
 *
 * The combat-damage trigger hands Kain to the damaged player. "That player" is
 * [Player.TriggeringPlayer], resolved through the existing [GiveControlToTargetPlayerEffect]
 * (newController = the triggering player, permanent = Kain itself). "If they do" is gated on the
 * control actually moving via [SuccessCriterion.ControlChanged] — so if a "can't gain control"
 * effect or Kain leaving the battlefield stops the hand-off, the rider is withheld, per the printed
 * text. The three riders all scale off the combat damage dealt ("that many/much"), read from
 * [ContextPropertyKey.TRIGGER_DAMAGE_AMOUNT]. They resolve for *you* — the ability's controller,
 * fixed when it triggered — not the new controller, matching "you draw / you lose".
