/**
 * The Emperor of Palamecia // The Lord Master of Hell — Final Fantasy #219
 * {U}{R} · Legendary Creature — Human Noble Wizard · 2/2 // Legendary Creature — Demon Noble Wizard · 3/3
 *
 * Front — The Emperor of Palamecia:
 *   {T}: Add {U} or {R}. Spend this mana only to cast a noncreature spell.
 *   Whenever you cast a noncreature spell, if at least four mana was spent to cast it, put a
 *   +1/+1 counter on The Emperor of Palamecia. Then if it has three or more +1/+1 counters
 *   on it, transform it.
 *
 * Back — The Lord Master of Hell:
 *   Starfall — Whenever The Lord Master of Hell attacks, it deals X damage to each opponent,
 *   where X is the number of noncreature, nonland cards in your graveyard.
 *
 * The restricted mana ability composes [ManaColorSet.Specific] (pick {U} or {R}) with the
 * negated card-type restriction ("noncreature spells only"). The cast trigger's four-mana
 * gate reads [ContextPropertyKey.MANA_SPENT_ON_TRIGGERING_SPELL] — the mana actually paid
 * for the *triggering* spell (the Opus idiom); the amount is fixed history, so checking it
 * at resolution is equivalent to the printed intervening-"if". The "Then if" transform check
 * runs after the counter lands, counting via [Conditions.SourceCounterCountAtLeast].
