/**
 * Neriv, Heart of the Storm — Tarkir: Dragonstorm #210
 * {1}{R}{W}{B} · Legendary Creature — Spirit Dragon · 4/5
 *
 * Flying
 * If a creature you control that entered this turn would deal damage, it deals twice
 * that much damage instead.
 *
 * The damage-doubling clause is a damage replacement effect ([DoubleDamage]) gated on the
 * damage source: a creature controlled by Neriv's controller that has the
 * [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.predicates.StatePredicate.EnteredThisTurn] state predicate
 * (tracked by `EnteredThisTurnComponent`, cleared at the start of each turn). This covers any
 * damage the creature deals — combat or ability — and applies to Neriv itself if it entered
 * this turn. `youControl()` resolves against the replacement source's controller.
