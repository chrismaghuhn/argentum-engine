/**
 * The Legend of Yangchen // Avatar Yangchen (TLA #27)
 * {3}{W}{W} — Enchantment — Saga
 * //  — Legendary Creature — Avatar 4/5
 *
 * Front — The Legend of Yangchen:
 *   (As this Saga enters and after your draw step, add a lore counter.)
 *   I — Starting with you, each player chooses up to one permanent with mana value 3 or greater
 *       from among permanents your opponents control. Exile those permanents.
 *   II — You may have target opponent draw three cards. If you do, draw three cards.
 *   III — Exile this Saga, then return it to the battlefield transformed under your control.
 *
 * Back — Avatar Yangchen:
 *   Flying
 *   Whenever you cast your second spell each turn, airbend up to one other target nonland permanent.
 *   (Exile it. While it's exiled, its owner may cast it for {2} rather than its mana cost.)
 *
 * **Chapter I** — the pool is *fixed* to the Saga controller's opponents' permanents (mana value 3+)
 * for every chooser, which is the wrinkle that separates it from Destined Confrontation / Bend or
 * Break (where each player picks from their *own* permanents). A naive `ForEachPlayerEffect` would be
 * wrong here: that facade rebinds the per-iteration controller, so `Player.You` / `opponentControls()`
 * inside the loop would resolve to *each chooser's* opponents — the opponent's iteration would then
 * draw from the Saga controller's own board, and there is no source-controller-anchored gather
 * predicate to pin it back. Instead we gather the shared pool once in the (unrebound) controller
 * context — `BattlefieldMatching(Permanent.opponentControls().manaValueAtLeast(3))`, whose controller
 * predicate resolves against the Saga controller — then run the APNAP "starting with you" picks as two
 * capped selects over that one collection: [Chooser.Controller] first, then [Chooser.Opponent] over the
 * *remainder* (`storeRemainder`), so a permanent an earlier chooser took can't be double-chosen. Both
 * picks are exiled after all choosing is done. (2-player scope — TLA is a 2-player set; `Chooser.Opponent`
 * routes to the single opponent.)
 *
 * **Chapter II** — a plain [Effects.May] over "target opponent draws 3, then you draw 3": one yes/no gates
 * the whole clause (the printed "If you do" — accept and both draw, decline and neither does).
 *
 * **Chapter III** — the standard transforming-Saga final chapter ([Effects.ExileAndReturnTransformed],
 * as on The Legend of Roku / Kuruk / The Rise of Sozin).
 *
 * The **back face** reuses the second-spell trigger (`Triggers.<player>.castsNth(n, spell)``(2, You)`, as on Breeches,
 * the Blastmaker) and the airbend primitive ([Effects.Airbend], the exile + fixed-{2}-recast-to-owner
 * tail) over an "up to one *other* target nonland permanent" requirement ([TargetOther] wrapping an
 * optional [TargetObject] — same shape as Aang, Swift Savior's ETB).
