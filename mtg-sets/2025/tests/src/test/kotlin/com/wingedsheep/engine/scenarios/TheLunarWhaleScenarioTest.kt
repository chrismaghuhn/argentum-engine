/**
 * Tests for The Lunar Whale.
 *
 * The Lunar Whale: {3}{U}
 * Legendary Artifact — Vehicle
 * 3/5
 * Flying
 * You may look at the top card of your library any time.
 * As long as The Lunar Whale attacked this turn, you may play the top card of your library.
 * Crew 1
 *
 * The "play the top card" permission is a [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.PlayLandsAndCastFilteredFromTopOfLibrary]
 * (unrestricted spell filter) gated by a [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.ConditionalStaticAbility] on
 * "this attacked this turn". These tests exercise the gate: the permission is dormant until the
 * Whale is crewed and attacks, then becomes active for the rest of the turn.
