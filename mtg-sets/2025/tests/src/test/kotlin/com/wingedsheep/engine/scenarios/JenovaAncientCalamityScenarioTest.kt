/**
 * Jenova, Ancient Calamity (FIN).
 *
 * - At the beginning of combat on your turn, put a number of +1/+1 counters equal to Jenova's
 *   power on up to one other target creature. That creature becomes a Mutant in addition to its
 *   other types.
 * - Whenever a Mutant you control dies during your turn, you draw cards equal to its power.
 *
 * Test 1 drives the combat trigger: a chosen other creature gains Jenova's power (1) in +1/+1
 * counters and the Mutant subtype (asserted via projected subtypes).
 *
 * Test 2 drives the dies payoff: the creature made a Mutant in test 1 is then destroyed on the
 * controller's turn, and the controller draws cards equal to that creature's last-known power.
