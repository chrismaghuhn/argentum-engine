/**
 * Scenario tests for Aegis Sculptor (TDM #35).
 *
 * "{3}{U} Creature — Bird Wizard 2/3. Flying, Ward {2}.
 *  At the beginning of your upkeep, you may exile two cards from your graveyard. If you do,
 *  put a +1/+1 counter on this creature."
 *
 * The test advances from player 2's turn into player 1's upkeep so the "your upkeep" trigger
 * fires for the Sculptor's controller. Verifies: with two graveyard cards, exiling both adds a
 * +1/+1 counter; with fewer than two, declining adds no counter.
