/**
 * Bartz and Boko (FIN #175) — {3}{G}{G} Legendary Creature — Human Bird 4/3.
 *
 * "Affinity for Birds. When Bartz and Boko enters, each other Bird you control deals damage equal
 *  to its power to target creature an opponent controls."
 *
 * Two Storm Crows (1/2 Birds) deal 1 each = 2 damage to a 4/4 victim, which therefore survives.
 * That survival is the proof that Bartz itself is excluded ("each *other* Bird"): were Bartz's own
 * power of 4 counted, the victim would take 6 and die.
