/**
 * Town land // spell DFC (FIN) — the inverse-Adventure layout (CR 715).
 *
 * These cards are land-primary Adventure cards: front = `Land — Town`, back = an instant/sorcery
 * `— Adventure`. From hand you either **play the land** or **cast the Adventure spell**; casting the
 * Adventure resolves its effect, exiles the card, and grants permission to **play the land** from
 * exile later (CR 715.3d — the engine's generic may-play permission covers playing a land, not just
 * casting a creature).
 *
 * No new layout was needed: `CardLayout.ADVENTURE` already models "spell resolves → exile → replay
 * the main face from exile"; the only seams that needed work were (a) enumerating the spell face for
 * a land-primary card (covered by `TownLandSpellAdventureEnumerationTest`) and (b) the existing
 * `CastFromZoneEnumerator` / `PlayLandHandler` exile-land path, exercised here end to end.
 *
 * Lindblum, Industrial Regency // Mage Siege — land face `Land — Town` ({T}: Add {R}); Adventure
 * face Mage Siege {2}{R}, Instant, "Create a 0/1 black Wizard creature token ...".
