/**
 * Weftwalking — Edge of Eternities mythic enchantment, {4}{U}{U}.
 *
 *   When this enchantment enters, if you cast it, shuffle your hand and graveyard into your
 *   library, then draw seven cards.
 *   The first spell each player casts during each of their turns may be cast without paying
 *   its mana cost.
 *
 * Two new pieces of behaviour are exercised here:
 *
 * 1. **ETB-if-cast** ([Conditions.WasCast]) — the shuffle-and-draw fires only when Weftwalking is
 *    cast, not when it enters via another path (verified by checking the cast path triggers the
 *    library reshuffle and a 7-card draw).
 *
 * 2. **Free-cast static** ([MayCastWithoutPayingManaCost] with `firstSpellOfTurnOnly = true`) —
 *    the caster's first spell during each of their own turns gets a `{0}` alternative cost; once
 *    the caster has cast a spell this turn the gate closes.
