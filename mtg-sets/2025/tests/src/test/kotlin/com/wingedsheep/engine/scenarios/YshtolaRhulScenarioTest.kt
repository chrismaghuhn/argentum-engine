/**
 * Y'shtola Rhul (FIN) — {4}{U}{U} Legendary Creature — Cat Druid 3/5
 *
 * "At the beginning of your end step, exile target creature you control, then return it to the
 *  battlefield under its owner's control. Then if it's the first end step of the turn, there is an
 *  additional end step after this step."
 *
 * Exercises the new [Effects.AddAdditionalEndSteps] / `AdditionalEndStepsComponent` turn-structure
 * path and the [com.wingedsheep.sdk.dsl.Conditions.IsFirstEndStepOfTurn] loop guard.
 *
 * The blink target is a creature whose only ability is "when it enters, you gain 1 life", so each
 * time Y'shtola's end-step trigger resolves the target re-enters and the controller gains 1 life.
 * That makes the life swing a direct count of how many end steps actually happened:
 *  - Without the feature, Y'shtola would trigger once → +1 life.
 *  - With one additional end step (and exactly one — the rider is gated to the *first* end step),
 *    Y'shtola triggers twice → +2 life, and the turn still ends (no infinite loop).
