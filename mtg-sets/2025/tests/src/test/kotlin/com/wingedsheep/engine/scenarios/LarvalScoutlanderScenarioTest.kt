/**
 * Reproduction test for the Larval Scoutlander (EOE #194) bug.
 *
 * The card's ETB clause reads:
 *  "When this Spacecraft enters, you may sacrifice a land or Lander. If you do, search your
 *   library for up to two basic land cards, put them onto the battlefield tapped, then shuffle."
 *
 * Bug surfaced in play: the may-sacrifice prompt fires and a land is sacrificed, but the
 * library-search payoff never delivers — no basic lands hit the battlefield and the library
 * is not shuffled. This is the "Effects.May(Sacrifice.then(search))" vs. correct
 * "Effects.IfYouDo(Sacrifice, search)" mis-modeling: the whole composite gets gated as one
 * yes/no instead of the sacrifice acting as the action whose outcome gates the search.
 *
 * This test exercises the full flow Alice would experience and asserts on each visible
 * step. It is expected to FAIL today on the post-sacrifice payoff.
