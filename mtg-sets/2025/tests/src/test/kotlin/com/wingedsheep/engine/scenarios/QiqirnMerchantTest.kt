/**
 * Tests for Qiqirn Merchant (FIN) — proves activated-ability cost reduction *by permanent count*.
 *
 * "{7}, {T}, Sacrifice this creature: Draw three cards. This ability costs {1} less to activate for
 * each Town you control." rides the engine's per-activation
 * [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.ActivatedAbility.genericCostReduction] field fed
 * `DynamicAmounts.battlefield(You, Land — Town).count()`. The same field already powers
 * The Dominion Bracelet (X = creature's power) and Dragonfire Blade (X = target's color count);
 * here the [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.values.DynamicAmount] is a battlefield count, so no new
 * engine vocabulary is required — these tests pin that the reduction lowers the displayed/affordable
 * and paid generic cost, floors at {0}, and never goes negative.
 *
 * A Town here is an inert "Land — Town" with no mana ability, so the only mana available is what the
 * test grants — exact-cost assertions stay clean.
