/**
 * Bottomless Pit (STH) — {1}{B}{B} Enchantment.
 *
 * "At the beginning of each player's upkeep, that player discards a card at random."
 *
 * Pins the each-player upkeep scope (`Triggers.anyPlayer.beginningOf(Step.UPKEEP)`) drafted by mtgish-tooling: the trigger
 * fires on EVERY player's upkeep — its controller's AND its opponent's — and the discarding player
 * is the player whose upkeep it is. The discard is at random, so no decision is required.
