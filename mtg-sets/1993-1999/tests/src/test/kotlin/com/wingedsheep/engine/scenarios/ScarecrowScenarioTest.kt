/**
 * Scarecrow (DRK #108) — "{6}, {T}: Prevent all damage that would be dealt to you this turn by
 * creatures with flying."
 *
 * The shield names a *player* as its recipient and narrows the *source* side to a filter, which is
 * [com.wingedsheep.sdk.dsl.Effects.PreventDamage] with `alsoToYou` and no `toGroup`: the recipient
 * half of the group shield is empty and only `recipientGroupIncludesController` is set.
 *
 * What these tests pin:
 *   - combat damage from a flying attacker to you is prevented,
 *   - a non-flying attacker is unaffected — the source filter really filters,
 *   - a non-creature source (Lightning Bolt) is unaffected,
 *   - only *you* are protected: a flier's combat damage to your own creature still kills it.
 *
 * Scarecrow is activated during the opponent's turn, because the shield lasts only "this turn"
 * and the flying attacker is theirs.
