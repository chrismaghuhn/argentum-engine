/**
 * Tawnos's Coffin
 * {4}
 * Artifact
 * You may choose not to untap this artifact during your untap step.
 * {3}, {T}: Exile target creature and all Auras attached to it. Note the number and kind of
 * counters that were on that creature. When this artifact leaves the battlefield or becomes
 * untapped, return that exiled card to the battlefield under its owner's control tapped with the
 * noted number and kind of counters on it. If you do, return the other exiled cards to the
 * battlefield under their owner's control attached to that permanent.
 *
 * A state-preserving "blink" tied to the source untapping or leaving:
 *  - The optional "may choose not to untap" half is [AbilityFlag.MAY_NOT_UNTAP] (so the Coffin can
 *    hold a creature exiled indefinitely by leaving itself tapped).
 *  - The activated ability exiles the creature + its Auras (linked to the Coffin) and notes the
 *    creature's counters ([Effects.ExileWithAurasNotingCounters]).
 *  - Both the leaves-the-battlefield and the becomes-untapped triggers run
 *    [Effects.ReturnNotedExileTappedWithAuras], which returns the creature tapped under its owner's
 *    control with the noted counters, then re-attaches the Auras (Auras that can't legally
 *    re-attach go to their owners' graveyards via the unattached-Aura SBA). The return effect is a
 *    no-op when nothing is noted, so the two triggers are safe to share.
