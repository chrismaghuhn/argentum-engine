 * {6}, {T}: Prevent all damage that would be dealt to you this turn by creatures with flying.
 *
 * The shield protects the controller, not Scarecrow itself, and it is not combat-only: an
 * activated ability of a flying creature that damages you is prevented too. The source filter is
 * re-read from projected state at damage time, so a creature that gains or loses flying after the
 * ability resolves is judged as it is when the damage happens.
