/**
 * Artifact Ward
 * {W}
 * Enchantment — Aura
 * Enchant creature
 * Enchanted creature can't be blocked by artifact creatures.
 * Prevent all damage that would be dealt to enchanted creature by artifact sources.
 * Enchanted creature can't be the target of abilities from artifact sources.
 *
 * Three clauses, all keyed to the enchanted creature:
 *  - [CantBeBlockedBy] artifact creatures (block restriction),
 *  - a continuous [PreventDamage] replacement (CR 615) with recipient = the enchanted creature and
 *    source = any artifact, and
 *  - [CantBeTargetedBySourceTypeAbilities] with [CardType.ARTIFACT] — hexproof keyed to the source
 *    *card type* (blocks abilities from artifact sources, regardless of who controls them).
 *    Deliberately NOT modelled as protection from artifacts, which would also stop the creature from
 *    being equipped/enchanted by artifacts; this clause does not.
