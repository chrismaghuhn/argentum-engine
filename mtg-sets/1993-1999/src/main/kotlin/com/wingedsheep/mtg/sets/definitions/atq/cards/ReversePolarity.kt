 * You gain X life, where X is twice the damage dealt to you so far this turn by artifacts.
 *
 * The per-turn "damage dealt to you by artifact sources" accumulator is tracked by the engine
 * (`TurnTracker.DAMAGE_RECEIVED_FROM_ARTIFACTS`); `Multiply(..., 2)` doubles it. Both combat and
 * non-combat artifact damage count; prevented damage does not, and damage from non-artifact
 * sources is excluded — so with no artifact damage this turn, X = 0.
