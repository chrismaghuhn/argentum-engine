/**
 * Titania's Song
 * {3}{G}
 * Enchantment
 * Each noncreature artifact loses all abilities and becomes an artifact creature with power and
 * toughness each equal to its mana value. If this enchantment leaves the battlefield, this effect
 * continues until end of turn.
 *
 * Modeled as three continuous group statics over noncreature artifacts (CR 613):
 *  - Layer 4 (TYPE): GrantCardType("CREATURE") — makes them creatures (already artifacts).
 *  - Layer 6 (ABILITY): LoseAllAbilities.
 *  - Layer 7b (POWER_TOUGHNESS, SET_VALUES): SetBasePowerToughnessDynamicStatic with each
 *    permanent's own mana value (EffectTarget.AffectedEntity → ManaValue).
 *
 * The "noncreature artifact" filter (`Artifact.notCreature()`) is locked in at effect-collection
 * time — it is not a [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.predicates.CardPredicate.IsCreature]-keyed
 * filter, so the projector does not re-resolve it after Layer 4 turns the artifacts into
 * creatures; the same set is animated, stripped, and re-sized in Layers 4/6/7b (the
 * Opalescence/Conspiracy locked-set rule).
 *
 * The "continues until end of turn" linger is a leaves-the-battlefield self-trigger that replays
 * the same animate-with-ability-removal as one-shot floating effects (Effects.MassAnimate, P/T = mana value)
 * over whatever noncreature artifacts exist when the enchantment leaves.
