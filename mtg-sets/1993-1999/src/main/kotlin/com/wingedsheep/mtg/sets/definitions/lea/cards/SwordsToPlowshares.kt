/**
 * Swords to Plowshares
 * {W}
 * Instant
 * Exile target creature. Its controller gains life equal to its power.
 *
 * The life gain ([DynamicAmounts.targetPower]) is sequenced *before* the exile, inverting
 * the printed order. This is a workaround, not a rules claim: target references read the
 * live board only, so a power read taken after the exile falls through to the card's printed
 * P/T and would ignore counters, Auras and lords. Gaining first reads the projected power and
 * controller while the creature is still on the battlefield, which is the value CR 608.2h and
 * the card's ruling ask for. Same house pattern as Crumble.
 *
 * The life gained is identical under either order. The one divergence is that a
 * leaves-the-battlefield trigger observes the post-gain board, which can only matter for a
 * creature whose power keys off a life total (Serra Ascendant, Serra Avatar).
