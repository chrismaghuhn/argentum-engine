/**
 * Powerleech
 * {G}{G}
 * Enchantment
 * Whenever an artifact an opponent controls becomes tapped or an opponent activates an artifact's
 * ability without {T} in its activation cost, you gain 1 life.
 *
 * Same "tap / activate an artifact" punisher template as Haunting Wind, but scoped to opponents'
 * artifacts and rewarding the enchantment's controller with life instead of dealing damage:
 *  - tap half: `Triggers.<subject>.becomesTapped(reason, firstTimeEachTurn)` over `Artifact.opponentControls()` ("an artifact an
 *    opponent controls becomes tapped").
 *  - ability half: `Triggers.<player>.activatesAbility(of, withoutTapInCost = true)` with [Player.EachOpponent] and NO
 *    controller restriction on the artifact — oracle only requires that "an opponent activates
 *    an artifact's ability", so an opponent activating an any-player ability of an artifact
 *    you control (e.g. Armageddon Clock) also triggers it.
 *
 * The reward is [Effects.GainLife] for the controller (default target), so no triggering-entity
 * reference is needed.
