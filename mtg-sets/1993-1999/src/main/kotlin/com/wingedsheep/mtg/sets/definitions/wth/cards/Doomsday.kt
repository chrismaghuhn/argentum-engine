/**
 * Doomsday
 * {B}{B}{B}
 * Sorcery
 * Search your library and graveyard for five cards and exile the rest. Put the chosen cards on
 * top of your library in any order. You lose half your life, rounded up.
 *
 * One Gather → Select → Move pipeline over both zones at once
 * ([CardSource.FromMultipleZones]) — the search is a single choice across library *and* graveyard,
 * so gathering them separately would let a player pick five from each. `chooseExactlySplit` is what
 * makes the rest reachable: the non-selected cards land in the remainder slot and are exiled, which
 * is the printed "and exile the rest".
 *
 * The two rulings below fall out of the primitive rather than needing a special case.
 * "You can't choose to find fewer than five" is `ChooseExactly`, not `ChooseUpTo`; and with fewer
 * than five cards between the two zones the executor auto-selects everything eligible and leaves an
 * empty remainder, so all of them wind up back on the library and nothing is exiled.
 *
 * No shuffle: Doomsday sets the top of the library deliberately, which is the whole card. The
 * search still emits [EmitLibrarySearchedEventEffect] so "whenever a player searches their library"
 * (Aven Mindcensor, Leonin Arbiter) sees it.
