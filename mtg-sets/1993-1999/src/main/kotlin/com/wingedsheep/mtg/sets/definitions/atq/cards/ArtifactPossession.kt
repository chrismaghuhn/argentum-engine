/**
 * Artifact Possession
 * {2}{B}
 * Enchantment — Aura
 * Enchant artifact
 * Whenever enchanted artifact becomes tapped or a player activates an ability of enchanted
 * artifact without {T} in its activation cost, this Aura deals 2 damage to that artifact's
 * controller.
 *
 * The single-target ([TriggerBinding.ATTACHED]) member of the Antiquities "tap / activate an
 * artifact" punisher template (cf. Haunting Wind, Powerleech): both triggers fire only off the
 * enchanted artifact. Routed through `AttachmentTriggerDetector`, which exposes the enchanted
 * artifact as the triggering entity, so "that artifact's controller" resolves via
 * [EffectTarget.ControllerOfTriggeringEntity] for both halves.
