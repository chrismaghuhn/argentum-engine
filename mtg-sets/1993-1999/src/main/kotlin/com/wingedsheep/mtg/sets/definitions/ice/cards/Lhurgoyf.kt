/**
 * Lhurgoyf
 * {2}{G}{G}
 * Creature — Lhurgoyf
 * Characteristic-defining power/toughness — see dynamicStats below.
 *
 * Lhurgoyf's power is equal to the number of creature cards in all graveyards and its toughness is
 * equal to that number plus 1.
 *
 * The original *-body: a characteristic-defining ability (CR 604.3), so it is `dynamicStats` rather
 * than a printed P/T plus a pump — one [DynamicAmount] feeds base power and base toughness in layer
 * 7a and functions in every zone. [Player.Each] is what makes "all graveyards" all of them, and the
 * "plus 1" is `toughnessOffset` on that same amount rather than a second value, so the two halves
 * can never drift apart. Soulless One reads graveyards the same way.
