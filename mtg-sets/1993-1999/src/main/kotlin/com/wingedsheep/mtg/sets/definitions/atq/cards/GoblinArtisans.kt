/**
 * Goblin Artisans
 * {R}
 * Creature — Goblin Artificer
 * 1/1
 * {T}: Flip a coin. If you win the flip, draw a card. If you lose the flip, counter target artifact
 *   spell you control that isn't the target of an ability from another creature named Goblin
 *   Artisans.
 *
 * The coin-flip win/lose branch ([FlipCoinEffect]) and the targeted counter ([Effects.CounterSpell])
 * compose from existing primitives; the activation targets the artifact spell up front (locked at
 * activation, countered only on a lost flip). The self-referential targeting restriction is the
 * engine gap: `GameObjectFilter.notTargetedByAbilityFromSameNamedSource()`
 * ([com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.predicates.StatePredicate.NotTargetedByAbilityFromSameNamedSource])
 * excludes any artifact spell already targeted by an ability on the stack from *another* Goblin
 * Artisans — so two Goblin Artisans can't both lock onto the same spell.
