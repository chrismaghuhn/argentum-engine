/**
 * The Rack
 * {1}
 * Artifact
 *
 * As this artifact enters, choose an opponent.
 * At the beginning of the chosen player's upkeep, this artifact deals X damage to that player,
 * where X is 3 minus the number of cards in their hand.
 *
 * The choose-an-opponent-as-it-enters half reuses the existing [EntersWithChoice]`(ChoiceType.OPPONENT)`
 * replacement (same as Cursed Rack / Jihad), storing the chosen player on the permanent under
 * `ChoiceSlot.OPPONENT`. The upkeep trigger is keyed to that chosen player via
 * [Player.ChosenOpponent]: `Triggers.chosenOpponent.beginningOf(Step.UPKEEP)` (`StepEvent(UPKEEP, ChosenOpponent)`) now
 * resolves in `TriggerMatcher.matchesPlayerForStep` against the source's stored choice, so it fires
 * only on the chosen player's upkeep — not on every player's. Damage and the dynamic amount both read
 * `Player.ChosenOpponent` off the source, so "that player" / "their hand" resolve to the chosen player.
 * X = 3 − cards in their hand (a negative result deals no damage).
