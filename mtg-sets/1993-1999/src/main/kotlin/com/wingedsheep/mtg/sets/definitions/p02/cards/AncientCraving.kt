 * Ancient Craving

 *
 * Portal Second Age is the card's earliest real-expansion printing, so the canonical
 * [com.wingedsheep.sdk.model.CardDefinition] lives here.
 *
 * The life loss is not a cost and not optional — both halves resolve, in printed order, and the
 * draw happens even if the loss would be lethal (state-based actions check afterwards).
