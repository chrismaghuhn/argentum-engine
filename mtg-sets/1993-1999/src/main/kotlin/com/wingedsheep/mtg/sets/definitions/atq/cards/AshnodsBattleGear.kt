 * A "tap-locked" buff (cf. Tawnos's Weaponry, Everglove Courier): the +2/-2 is a
 * [Effects.ModifyStats] with [Duration.WhileSourceTapped], lasting only while Battle Gear stays
 * tapped and ending when it untaps. The optional self untap-skip is [AbilityFlag.MAY_NOT_UNTAP].
 * Note the modern oracle restricts the target to a creature you control.
