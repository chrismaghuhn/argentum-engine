 * Enchant creature
 * Enchanted creature has banding.
 *
 * The plain keyword-granting Aura shape: `auraTarget = Targets.Creature` carries the enchant
 * restriction, and `GrantKeyword` needs no filter because its default is
 * `GroupFilter.attachedCreature()` — exactly "enchanted creature". Banding is engine-live, so the
 * grant is real combat behaviour rather than a display keyword.
