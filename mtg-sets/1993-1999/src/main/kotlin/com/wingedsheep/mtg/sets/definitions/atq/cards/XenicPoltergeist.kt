/**
 * Xenic Poltergeist
 * {1}{B}{B}
 * Creature — Spirit
 * 1/1
 * {T}: Until your next upkeep, target noncreature artifact becomes an artifact creature with power
 *   and toughness each equal to its mana value.
 *
 * Antiquities engine gap: animating a single target with *dynamic* P/T equal to the target's own
 * mana value. [Effects.BecomeCreatureWithManaValueStats] (a new facade over the extended
 * [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.effects.BecomeCreatureEffect], which now accepts optional dynamic
 * P/T) sets base P/T via a Layer 7b `SetPowerToughnessDynamic(ManaValue, ManaValue)` keyed to the
 * affected entity, adds the CREATURE type (the artifact stays an artifact via `addTypes`), and
 * lasts until the controller's next upkeep ([Duration.UntilYourNextUpkeep]). The target must be a
 * noncreature artifact (`GameObjectFilter.Artifact.notCreature()`).
