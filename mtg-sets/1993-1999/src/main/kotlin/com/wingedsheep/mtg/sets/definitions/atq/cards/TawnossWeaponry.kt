 * Tawnos's Weaponry

 * Artifact
 * You may choose not to untap this artifact during your untap step.
 * {2}, {T}: Target creature gets +1/+1 for as long as this artifact remains tapped.
 *
 * A "tap-locked" buff (cf. Everglove Courier): the +1/+1 is a [Effects.ModifyStats] with the
 * [Duration.WhileSourceTapped] duration, so it lasts only while Tawnos's Weaponry stays tapped and
 * drops the instant it untaps. The optional self untap-skip is the [AbilityFlag.MAY_NOT_UNTAP]
 * flag, letting the controller hold it tapped through their untap step to keep the bonus alive.
