/**
 * Mulch — Stronghold #110
 * {1}{G} · Sorcery
 *
 * Reveal the top four cards of your library. Put all land cards revealed this way into your hand
 * and the rest into your graveyard.
 *
 * The Marina Vendrell recipe with the remainder routed one zone over:
 * [Patterns.Library.revealTopPutAllMatchingToHand] gathers the top four, reveals them publicly, and
 * partitions them with a choice-free `FilterCollection` — every land card goes to hand, everything
 * else to `restDestination`. Mulch's remainder is the graveyard rather than the bottom of the
 * library, and it names no order, so the cards keep their gathered (top-down) order
 * ([CardOrder.Preserve]) instead of the recipe's default reshuffle: a random order is a real
 * instruction ("in a random order") that this card doesn't print.
 *
 * The reveal is mandatory and the partition is automatic — there is no "up to one" choice here, so
 * nothing pauses for player input and a library holding fewer than four cards simply reveals what
 * is left.
