/**
 * Metamorphosis

 * Sorcery
 * As an additional cost to cast this spell, sacrifice a creature.
 * Add X mana of any one color, where X is 1 plus the sacrificed creature's mana value.
 * Spend this mana only to cast creature spells.
 *
 * The sacrificed creature's mana value is read from the cost-payment snapshot
 * (last-known information), since the creature is in the graveyard by resolution
 * time — see [EffectTarget.SacrificedAsCost]. The produced mana is a single chosen
 * color, added `1 + the sacrificed creature's mana value` times, carrying
 * [ManaRestriction.CreatureSpellsOnly] so it can only pay for creature spells
 * (including their additional costs such as Kicker, per the 2004 ruling).
