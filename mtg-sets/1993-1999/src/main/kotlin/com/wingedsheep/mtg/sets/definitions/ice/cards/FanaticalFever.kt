 * Target creature gets +3/+0 and gains trample until end of turn.
 *
 * One target shared by two effects — the pump and the keyword grant both point at the same bound
 * variable — so it is a `Composite` over one requirement rather than two separate clauses. Both
 * primitives already default to `Duration.EndOfTurn`, which is what "until end of turn" means here.
