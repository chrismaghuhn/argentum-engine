/**
 * Nacre Talisman
 * {2}
 * Artifact
 *
 * Whenever a player casts a white spell, you may pay {3}. If you do, untap target permanent.
 *
 * One of Ice Age's five Talismans — the cycle is a single shape with the spell filter recoloured.
 * "A player" is every player, this artifact's controller included, so the trigger is
 * `Triggers.anyPlayer.casts(spell, requires)` (binding ANY, `Player.Each`); the ransom is [Effects.MayPay], whose
 * yes/no and mana payment both happen on resolution. The permanent is a real target declared on the
 * ability, so it is locked in when the trigger goes on the stack, before anyone decides to pay.
