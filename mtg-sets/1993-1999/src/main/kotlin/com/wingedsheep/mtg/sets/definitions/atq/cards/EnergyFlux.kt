/**
 * Energy Flux
 * {2}{U}
 * Enchantment
 * All artifacts have "At the beginning of your upkeep, sacrifice this artifact unless you pay {2}."
 *
 * The artifact-flavored sibling of Vile Consumption: a [GrantTriggeredAbility] static over
 * [GroupFilter.AllArtifacts] gives every artifact on the battlefield — including opponents' — its
 * own beginning-of-upkeep trigger. Because the granted trigger uses `Triggers.you.beginningOf(Step.UPKEEP)`, the
 * engine resolves "your upkeep" against the *affected artifact's controller* (TriggerMatcher keys
 * the step off each granted permanent's controller, not Energy Flux's controller), so each artifact
 * is taxed on its own controller's upkeep. [PayOrSufferEffect] then lets that controller
 * (EffectTarget.Controller, the default) pay {2}; if they decline, the granted artifact itself
 * (EffectTarget.Self) is sacrificed.
