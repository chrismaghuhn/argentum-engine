/**
 * Drop of Honey
 * {G}
 * Enchantment
 * At the beginning of your upkeep, destroy the creature with the least power. It can't be
 * regenerated. If two or more creatures are tied for least power, you choose one of them.
 * When there are no creatures on the battlefield, sacrifice this enchantment.
 *
 * Composition (one new SDK primitive — the global least-power selector):
 *  - The upkeep trigger uses [Effects.DestroyLeastPowerCreature], which gathers every creature
 *    tied for the global minimum power (`HasLeastPowerAmongAllCreatures`), lets the controller
 *    pick one (auto when unique, a choice on a tie), and destroys it without regeneration.
 *  - "When there are no creatures on the battlefield" is a `stateTriggeredAbility`
 *    (CR 603.8) gated on the global [Conditions.NoCreaturesOnBattlefield], mirroring Serendib
 *    Djinn's "when you control no lands" self-sacrifice.
