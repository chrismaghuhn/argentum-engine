 * The self-exempt clause ("This effect doesn't remove this Aura") is currently
 * moot in the engine: UnattachedAurasCheck only sends Auras to the graveyard
 * when the attached target is missing, not when it's an illegal attachment per
 * Rule 704.5n (color protection). If 704.5n is ever wired up, this clause will
