/**
 * Drafna's Restoration
 * {U}
 * Sorcery
 * Put any number of target artifact cards from target player's graveyard on top of their library
 * in any order.
 *
 * Two separate targets: a player (index 0), then *any number* of artifact cards in that player's
 * graveyard. The graveyard-card target's filter is `GameObjectFilter.Artifact.ownedByTargetPlayer()`
 * in `Zone.GRAVEYARD` (reusing the Hurkyl's-Recall `OwnedByTargetPlayer` predicate). The engine's
 * `TargetValidator` now threads the chosen player target into graveyard-card validation, so
 * `OwnedByTargetPlayer` resolves "target player's graveyard".
 *
 * The chosen cards are gathered ([CardSource.ChosenTargets]) and moved to the top of the owner's
 * library with [CardOrder.ControllerChooses] — the caster orders them when more than one is chosen.
