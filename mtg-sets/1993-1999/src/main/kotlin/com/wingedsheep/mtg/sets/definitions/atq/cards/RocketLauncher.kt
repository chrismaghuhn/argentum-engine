/**
 * Rocket Launcher
 * {4}
 * Artifact
 * {2}: This artifact deals 1 damage to any target. Destroy this artifact at the beginning of the
 *   next end step. Activate only if you've controlled this artifact continuously since the
 *   beginning of your most recent turn.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 * - The activation timing clause is the artifact "summoning sickness" condition
 *   ([ActivationRestriction.ControlledSinceYourMostRecentTurn]): the ability can't be used the turn
 *   Rocket Launcher enters, nor the turn its control changes, but becomes available once it has been
 *   under your control since the start of your most recent turn.
 * - "Destroy this artifact at the beginning of the next end step" is a delayed trigger scheduled by
 *   the ability ([CreateDelayedTriggerEffect] at [Step.END]).
