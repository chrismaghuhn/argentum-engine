/**
 * Zuran Enchanter

 * Creature — Human Wizard
 * 1/1
 *
 * {2}{B}, {T}: Target player discards a card. Activate only during your turn.
 *
 * The discard is [Patterns.Hand]'s gather → select → move recipe with the *target player* as both
 * the hand's owner and the chooser — restating those three steps by hand drops the `moveType` and
 * the prompt. "Activate only during your turn" is an [ActivationRestriction], not a
 * `TimingRule`: unlike Wall of Distortion's "only as a sorcery", this one still permits activation
 * at instant speed during your own turn.
