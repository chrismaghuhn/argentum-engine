/**
 * Ydwen Efreet
 * {R}{R}{R}
 * Creature — Efreet
 * 3/6
 * Whenever this creature blocks, flip a coin. If you lose the flip, remove this creature
 * from combat and it can't block this turn. Creatures it was blocking that had become
 * blocked by only this creature this combat become unblocked.
 *
 * The "become unblocked" clause is the pre-modern remove-from-combat behavior preserved on
 * the card; modern CR 509.1h normally keeps a creature blocked after all its blockers leave
 * combat. Toggled via [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.effects.RemoveFromCombatEffect.unblockSoleBlockedAttackers].
