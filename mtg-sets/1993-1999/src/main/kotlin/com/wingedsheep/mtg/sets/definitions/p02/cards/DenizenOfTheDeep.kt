/**
 * Denizen of the Deep
 * {6}{U}{U}
 * Creature — Serpent
 * 11/11
 * When this creature enters, return each other creature you control to its owner's hand.
 *
 * Portal Second Age is the card's earliest real-expansion printing, so the canonical
 * [com.wingedsheep.sdk.model.CardDefinition] lives here.
 *
 * "Each **other**" is `excludeSelf` on the group filter — the Denizen itself stays on the
 * battlefield — and the drawback is not optional or targeted, so it also bounces creatures that
 * would be illegal targets. Each card goes to its *owner's* hand, not its controller's.
