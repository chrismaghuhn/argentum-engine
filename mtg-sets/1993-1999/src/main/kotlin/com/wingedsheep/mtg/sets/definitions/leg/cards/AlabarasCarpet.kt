 * The recipient is the controller alone: `alsoToYou` with no `toGroup` is the recipient-side
 * shield naming only "you", narrowed to damage from attacking creatures without flying. Damage those
 * creatures deal to anything else (a blocker, a planeswalker) is not prevented. Both halves are
 * re-read when damage would be dealt, so a creature that gains flying mid-combat is no longer covered.
