/**
 * Sleight of Hand
 * {U}
 * Sorcery
 * Look at the top two cards of your library. Put one of them into your hand and the other on
 * the bottom of your library.
 *
 * Canonical printing lives in Portal Second Age (P02), the card's earliest real printing.
 * Later reprints (e.g. Wilds of Eldraine) contribute only a [com.wingedsheep.sdk.model.Printing] row.
 *
 * Modeled with the standard dig recipe [Patterns.Library.lookAtTopAndKeep]: gather the top two,
 * keep one in hand, the single remaining card goes to the bottom of the library.
