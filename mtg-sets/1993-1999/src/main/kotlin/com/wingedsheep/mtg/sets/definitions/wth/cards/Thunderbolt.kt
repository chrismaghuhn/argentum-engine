/**
 * Thunderbolt
 * {1}{R}
 * Instant
 *
 * Choose one —
 * - Thunderbolt deals 3 damage to target player or planeswalker.
 * - Thunderbolt deals 4 damage to target creature with flying.
 *
 * An ordinary "choose one" — two modes, one pick, each carrying its own target. The second mode is
 * narrowed to creatures *with flying*, which the target legality check reads off projected state,
 * so a creature that lost flying this turn is no longer a legal choice.
