 * Enchantment — Aura
 *
 * Enchant creature
 * Enchanted creature has swampwalk.
 *
 * The Cave Sense shape without the stat bump: one `GrantKeyword` on the default
 * `attachedCreature()` filter, plus the `auraTarget` enchant restriction. Granted landwalk is
 * engine-live — `BlockEvasionRules.LandwalkRule` reads the keyword out of projected state and maps
 * `SWAMPWALK` to the Swamp subtype — so the grant behaves exactly like a printed one.
