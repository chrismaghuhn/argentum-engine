/**
 * Armageddon Clock
 * {6}
 * Artifact
 * At the beginning of your upkeep, put a doom counter on this artifact.
 * At the beginning of your draw step, this artifact deals damage equal to the number of doom
 * counters on it to each player.
 * {4}: Remove a doom counter from this artifact. Any player may activate this ability but only
 * during any upkeep step.
 *
 * Composed from existing primitives plus the new passive [CounterType.DOOM] counter (the only engine
 * addition). The accrual is a `Triggers.you.beginningOf(Step.UPKEEP)` trigger that adds one doom counter
 * ([Effects.AddCounters]). The payoff is a `Triggers.you.beginningOf(Step.DRAW)` trigger that deals
 * `countersOnSelf(DOOM)` damage to each player ([EffectTarget.PlayerRef] over [Player.Each]). The
 * {4} ability removes one doom counter and is gated by [ActivationRestriction.All] of
 * [ActivationRestriction.AnyPlayerMay] (every player, not just the controller) and
 * [ActivationRestriction.DuringStep] of [Step.UPKEEP] (CR 602.1b activation instructions: "Any
 * player may activate this ability but only during any upkeep step").
