/**
 * Predatory Nightstalker
 * {3}{B}{B}
 * Creature — Nightstalker
 * 3/2
 * When this creature enters, you may have target opponent sacrifice a creature of their choice.
 *
 * Portal Second Age is the card's earliest real-expansion printing, so the canonical
 * [com.wingedsheep.sdk.model.CardDefinition] lives here.
 *
 * Cruel Edict's effect behind a consent gate: the opponent is targeted when the trigger goes on
 * the stack, and *they* pick which creature to sacrifice on resolution — sacrifice is not
 * targeting, so shroud and protection don't save the creature.
