/**
 * Martyrs of Korlis
 * {3}{W}{W}
 * Creature — Human
 * 1/6
 * As long as this creature is untapped, all damage that would be dealt to you by artifacts is
 * dealt to this creature instead.
 *
 * Antiquities engine gap: this is the first card to gate a static [RedirectDamage] replacement on
 * a *condition*. `RedirectDamage` gained an optional `condition: Condition?` (mirroring
 * `PreventDamage.restrictions`), evaluated against the replacement source at the moment damage
 * would be redirected. Here the gate is [Conditions.SourceIsUntapped] — when Martyrs is tapped the
 * condition fails and the damage is dealt to its controller normally; while untapped, all damage
 * from artifact sources to its controller is redirected to Martyrs ([EffectTarget.Self]).
 *
 * The source filter is `GameObjectFilter.Artifact` (the damage source must be an artifact);
 * `Recipient.You` is the replacement's controller (Martyrs's controller).
