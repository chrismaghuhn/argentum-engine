/**
 * Phyrexian Gremlins
 * {2}{B}
 * Creature — Phyrexian Gremlin
 * 1/1
 * You may choose not to untap this creature during your untap step.
 * {T}: Tap target artifact. It doesn't untap during its controller's untap step for as long as
 * this creature remains tapped.
 *
 * Imposed untap suppression. The {T} ability taps a target artifact ([Effects.Tap]) and grants it
 * [AbilityFlag.DOESNT_UNTAP] via [Effects.GrantKeyword] with the [Duration.WhileSourceTapped]
 * duration: while Phyrexian Gremlins remains tapped the artifact carries "doesn't untap", so it is
 * filtered out of *its own controller's* untap step (the untap step honors DOESNT_UNTAP for whoever
 * is untapping). The instant Gremlins untaps, the one-way `WhileSourceTapped` latch removes the
 * grant and the artifact untaps normally on its controller's next untap step. Holding Gremlins
 * tapped through your untap step ([AbilityFlag.MAY_NOT_UNTAP]) keeps the lock alive.
