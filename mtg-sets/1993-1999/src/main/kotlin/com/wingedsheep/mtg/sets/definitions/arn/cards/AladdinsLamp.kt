/**
 * Aladdin's Lamp
 * {10}
 * Artifact
 * {X}, {T}: The next time you would draw a card this turn, instead look at the top X cards of your
 * library, put all but one of them on the bottom of your library in a random order, then draw a
 * card. X can't be 0.
 *
 * Composition:
 *  - `{X}, {T}` activated ability whose only effect is `Effects.ReplaceNextDraw(...)` — it installs a
 *    one-shot draw-replacement shield for the rest of the turn. The shield now captures the
 *    activation-time {X} (see `ReplaceDrawWith.xValue`), so the replacement can read
 *    `DynamicAmount.XValue` when it fires at the next draw.
 *  - The replacement is a `lookAtTopAndKeep` dig: look at the top X, keep one on top, put the rest
 *    on the bottom in a random order, then a real `DrawCards(1)` draws the kept card (so draw
 *    triggers see a genuine draw). The shield is consumed before the inner draw, so it doesn't
 *    re-trigger itself.
 *  - "X can't be 0" is not separately enforced. With X=0 the dig looks at zero cards, so
 *    `SelectFromCollection` short-circuits on the empty collection (no prompt, empty kept/rest) and
 *    the inner `DrawCards(1)` runs as an ordinary draw. Covered by the X=0 scenario test.
