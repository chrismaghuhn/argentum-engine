/**
 * Old Man of the Sea
 * {1}{U}{U}
 * Creature — Djinn
 * 2/3
 * You may choose not to untap this creature during your untap step.
 * {T}: Gain control of target creature with power less than or equal to this creature's
 * power for as long as this creature remains tapped and that creature's power remains
 * less than or equal to this creature's power.
 *
 * Both halves of the duration are gated by [com.wingedsheep.engine.mechanics.layers.StateProjector]
 * for the instantaneous view: the projector skips the floating control effect when the source
 * isn't tapped, and reverts the target's controller in a post-Layer-7 fix-up the moment its
 * projected power exceeds the Old Man's projected power (counters, +X/+Y floating effects,
 * lord-style anthems). Per CR 611.2b the duration is one-way: once either half fails,
 * [com.wingedsheep.engine.mechanics.sba.permanent.EndedDurationExpiryCheck] physically removes
 * the floating effect, so a pump that later wears off — or a re-tap — does not re-steal the
 * creature.
