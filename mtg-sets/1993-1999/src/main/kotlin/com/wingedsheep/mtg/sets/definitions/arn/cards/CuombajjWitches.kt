/**
 * Cuombajj Witches
 * {B}{B}
 * Creature — Human Wizard
 * 1/3
 * {T}: This creature deals 1 damage to any target and 1 damage to any target of an opponent's choice.
 *
 * The first damage targets a creature, player, planeswalker, or battle the controller chooses; the
 * second is a separate, equally-real target that an opponent chooses (the controller picks which
 * opponent in a multiplayer game). Both targets are picked at announcement — see
 * [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.targets.TargetChooser] / `Targets.AnyChosenByOpponent`. Legality of
 * the opponent's target is measured relative to the controller (the ability's controller), so a
 * hexproof creature an opponent controls can't be chosen, exactly as the printed rulings state.
