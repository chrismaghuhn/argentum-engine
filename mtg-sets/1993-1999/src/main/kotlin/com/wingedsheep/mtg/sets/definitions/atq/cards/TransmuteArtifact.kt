/**
 * Transmute Artifact
 * {U}{U}
 * Sorcery
 * Sacrifice an artifact. If you do, search your library for an artifact card. If that card's mana
 * value is less than or equal to the sacrificed artifact's mana value, put it onto the battlefield.
 * If it's greater, you may pay {X}, where X is the difference. If you do, put it onto the
 * battlefield. If you don't, put it into its owner's graveyard. Then shuffle.
 *
 * Composed entirely from existing pipeline atoms — no new engine type:
 *  1. Gather artifacts you control → select exactly one ("sacrificed") and sacrifice it
 *     (`MoveType.Sacrifice`, owner's graveyard). The collection retains the entity id, so its mana
 *     value is still readable afterward via `StoredCardManaValue("sacrificed")`.
 *  2. Gated on having actually sacrificed one (`CollectionContainsMatch("sacrificed")` — the "if
 *     you do" leg): search your library, choosing up to one artifact card into "found" (without
 *     moving it yet), then branch on the mana-value comparison:
 *       - found MV ≤ sacrificed MV  → put "found" onto the battlefield.
 *       - else (found MV > sacrificed MV) → you may pay {X} = the difference; if you do, put it
 *         onto the battlefield; if you don't, put it into its owner's graveyard.
 *  3. Shuffle (always, since you searched your library).
 *
 * With no artifact to sacrifice, the "if you do" gate fails and the spell does nothing further;
 * with an empty selection the "found" collection is empty and the moves are no-ops.
