/**
 * Urza's Miter
 * {3}
 * Artifact
 * Whenever an artifact you control is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, if it wasn't
 * sacrificed, you may pay {3}. If you do, draw a card.
 *
 * The "if it wasn't sacrificed" intervening-if (CR 701.21) is expressed on the trigger via
 * `excludeSacrifice = true`: `TriggerMatcher.matchesZoneChangeTrigger` reads the triggering
 * `ZoneChangeEvent.wasSacrificed` flag (stamped by the central sacrifice hook) and suppresses the
 * trigger for sacrifices. Otherwise this mirrors the no-condition sibling Tablet of Epityr: an
 * artifact-you-control dies trigger ([TriggerBinding.ANY], since this artifact itself counts) with
 * an optional pay-{3}-then-draw.
