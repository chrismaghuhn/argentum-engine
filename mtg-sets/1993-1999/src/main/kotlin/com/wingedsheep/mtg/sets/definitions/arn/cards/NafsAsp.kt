/**
 * Nafs Asp
 * {G}
 * Creature — Snake
 * 1/1
 *
 * "Whenever this creature deals damage to a player, that player loses 1 life at
 * the beginning of their next draw step unless they pay {1} before that draw step."
 *
 * Modelled as: on damage, schedule a one-shot delayed trigger that fires at the
 * start of the damaged player's NEXT draw step. The damaged player is captured
 * via the new [CreateDelayedTriggerEffect.fireOnPlayer] axis, which both gates
 * the firing step to that player's turn and re-exposes them as
 * `Player.TriggeringPlayer` to the inner [PayOrSufferEffect] — so the same
 * player chooses to pay {1} or lose 1 life when the trigger resolves.
 *
 * The 2004 ruling "people commonly pay during upkeep" survives: the player gets
 * a single pay-or-suffer decision once the trigger lands on the stack at the
 * start of their draw step, before that step's turn-based draw.
