/**
 * Mishra's Factory
 * Land
 *
 * {T}: Add {C}.
 * {1}: This land becomes a 2/2 Assembly-Worker artifact creature until end of turn. It's still a land.
 * {T}: Target Assembly-Worker creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn.
 *
 * The animate ability uses [Effects.BecomeCreature] with `addTypes = setOf("ARTIFACT")` so the land
 * faithfully becomes a 2/2 **artifact** creature (not merely a creature) of subtype Assembly-Worker
 * while keeping its base Land type — the type-adding floating effects are additive in the type-changing
 * layer (Layer 4), so the existing Land card type is preserved ("It's still a land"). Prior to the
 * `addTypes` addition, animate effects could only grant CREATURE, dropping the artifact type.
 * The pump ability targets any Assembly-Worker creature (including this land once animated).
