/**
 * Haunting Wind
 * {3}{B}
 * Enchantment
 * Whenever an artifact becomes tapped or a player activates an artifact's ability without {T} in
 * its activation cost, this enchantment deals 1 damage to that artifact's controller.
 *
 * The Antiquities "tap / activate an artifact" punisher template (cf. Powerleech, Artifact
 * Possession). It is two triggers:
 *  - the tap half (`Triggers.<subject>.becomesTapped(reason, firstTimeEachTurn)` over [GameObjectFilter.Artifact]) — "that artifact's
 *    controller" is the controller of the just-tapped artifact, reached via
 *    [EffectTarget.ControllerOfTriggeringEntity].
 *  - the ability half (`Triggers.<player>.activatesAbility(of, withoutTapInCost = true)`) — keys on the literal "without {T}
 *    in its activation cost" wording (not "isn't a mana ability"), so a non-{T} mana ability also
 *    fires it. "That artifact's controller" is the controller of the activated artifact
 *    ([EffectTarget.ControllerOfTriggeringEntity]) — not the activating player, which differs
 *    when a non-controller activates (e.g. Armageddon Clock's any-player ability).
