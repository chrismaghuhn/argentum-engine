/**
 * Armored Kincaller — {2}{G}
 * Creature — Dinosaur
 * 3/3
 * When this creature enters, you may reveal a Dinosaur card from your hand.
 * If you do or if you control another Dinosaur, you gain 3 life.
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 *   The "if you do or if you control another Dinosaur" is modelled via a
 *   Gather → SelectUpTo(1) → Reveal pipeline over the controller's hand, storing the
 *   result in "kincallerRevealed". A Effects.If then gates GainLife(3) on an
 *   AnyCondition over two sub-checks:
 *     (1) CollectionContainsMatch("kincallerRevealed") — true iff the player actually
 *         selected a card to reveal.
 *     (2) YouControl(Creature.Dinosaur, excludeSelf = true) — true iff at least one
 *         other Dinosaur creature is on the battlefield (Kincaller itself is excluded).
 *
 *   This faithfully covers all three resolution paths:
 *     A. Player has a Dinosaur in hand and reveals it → collection non-empty → gain 3 life.
 *     B. Player has no Dinosaur in hand (or declines) but controls another Dinosaur → gain 3 life.
 *     C. Neither → no life gain.
 *
 *   When the player has no Dinosaur cards in hand, GatherCards yields an empty collection;
 *   SelectFromCollection auto-skips the prompt; RevealCollection is a no-op on the empty
 *   collection; and the AnyCondition falls through to the battlefield check.
