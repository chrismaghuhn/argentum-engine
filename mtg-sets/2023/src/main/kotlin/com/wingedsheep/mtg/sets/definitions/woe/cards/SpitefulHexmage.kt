/**
 * Spiteful Hexmage
 * {B}
 * Creature — Human Warlock
 * 3/2
 *
 * When this creature enters, create a Cursed Role token attached to target creature you control.
 * (If you control another Role on it, put that one into the graveyard. Enchanted creature is 1/1.)
 *
 * A 3/2 for one whose drawback is self-inflicted: the Cursed Role sets a creature you control to
 * base 1/1, so the Hexmage usually curses itself. The oracle text says "target creature you
 * control" (not "another"), so [Targets.CreatureYouControl] is correct — the Hexmage is a legal
 * target for its own trigger. The one-Role-per-creature rule (CR 704.5s) lives in the Role token
 * machinery behind [Effects.CreateRoleToken].
