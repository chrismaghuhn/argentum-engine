/**
 * Join the Dead — {1}{B}{B}
 * Instant (common, LCI #110)
 *
 * Target creature gets -5/-5 until end of turn.
 * Descend 4 — That creature gets -10/-10 until end of turn instead if there are four or more
 * permanent cards in your graveyard.
 *
 * The "Descend 4" clause is a resolution-time conditional: [Conditions.CardsInGraveyardMatchingAtLeast]
 * is evaluated when the spell resolves. If true, the -10/-10 branch fires via [Effects.If]
 * (lowers to GatedEffect with Gate.WhenCondition) and the -5/-5 branch is skipped. If false,
 * the -5/-5 branch fires instead. Both branches apply the modifier until end of turn (Layer 7c,
 * per CR 613).
 *
 * Rules note: "instead" in the Descend 4 line means the base -5/-5 does NOT also apply when
 * the condition is met — the two modifiers are mutually exclusive.
