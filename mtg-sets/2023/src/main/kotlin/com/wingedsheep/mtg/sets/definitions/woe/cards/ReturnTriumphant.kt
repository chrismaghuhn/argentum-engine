/**
 * Return Triumphant
 * {1}{W}
 * Sorcery
 *
 * Return target creature card with mana value 3 or less from your graveyard to the battlefield.
 * Create a Young Hero Role token attached to it.
 *
 * "Attached to it" is the creature this spell just reanimated, not a second target — the Role
 * rides along on the same [target] handle. Entity identity survives the graveyard → battlefield
 * move, so the reanimation and the attach can be sequenced in one [Effects.Composite]: by the
 * time [Effects.CreateRoleToken] runs, the card is already a permanent and a legal host.
 *
 * The single target is mandatory (not "up to one"), so with no legal creature card in your
 * graveyard the spell can't be cast, and a target that leaves the graveyard in response fizzles
 * the whole spell — no Role either.
