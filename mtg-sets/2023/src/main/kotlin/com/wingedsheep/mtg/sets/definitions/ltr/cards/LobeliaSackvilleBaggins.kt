/**
 * Lobelia Sackville-Baggins
 * {2}{B}
 * Legendary Creature — Halfling Citizen
 * 2/3
 * Flash · Menace
 *
 * When Lobelia enters, exile target creature card from an opponent's graveyard that was
 * put there from the battlefield this turn, then create X Treasure tokens, where X is
 * the exiled card's power.
 *
 * Uses `StatePredicate.PutIntoGraveyardFromBattlefieldThisTurn` (LTR Gap 20) restricted
 * to an opponent's graveyard. The Treasure count reads `Target(0).Power`, which evaluates
 * against the exiled card's base power after it lands in the exile zone. Although a card
 * that changes zones becomes a new object (CR 400.7), CR 400.7j lets the later part of the
 * same effect find the object it became in the public zone it moved to — so the "then
 * create X Treasures" half can still read the exiled card's power. Its base power is
 * unchanged from its graveyard reading.
