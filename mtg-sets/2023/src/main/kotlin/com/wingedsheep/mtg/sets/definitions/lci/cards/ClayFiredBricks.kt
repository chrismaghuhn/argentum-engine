/**
 * Clay-Fired Bricks // Cosmium Kiln (CR 702.167, The Lost Caverns of Ixalan)
 * {1}{W}
 * Artifact // Artifact
 *
 * Front face — Clay-Fired Bricks ({1}{W}, Artifact)
 *   When this artifact enters, search your library for a basic Plains card, reveal it,
 *   put it into your hand, then shuffle. You gain 2 life.
 *   Craft with artifact {5}{W}{W} ({5}{W}{W}, Exile this artifact, Exile another artifact
 *   you control or an artifact card from your graveyard: Return this card transformed
 *   under its owner's control. Craft only as a sorcery.)
 *
 * Back face — Cosmium Kiln (Artifact)
 *   When this artifact enters, create two 1/1 colorless Gnome artifact creature tokens.
 *   Creatures you control get +1/+1.
 *
 * Implementation: the front face's ETB is [Effects.Composite] sequencing the atomic
 * [Patterns.Library.searchLibrary] pipeline (basic Plains → reveal → hand → shuffle) before
 * [Effects.GainLife]. The `craft(...)` helper wires the activated ability with an
 * [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.AbilityCost.Craft] material cost (exactly one artifact:
 * minCount = maxCount = 1) paired with the printed mana cost; resolution returns the card
 * from exile as the back face via
 * [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.effects.ReturnSelfFromExileTransformedEffect]. The back
 * face's ETB fires off the normal battlefield-entry event when the craft return puts it
 * onto the battlefield transformed, creating the Gnomes with
 * [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.effects.CreateTokenEffect]; its anthem is a [ModifyStats]
 * static over [GameObjectFilter.Creature.youControl] (Glorious Anthem pattern).
