/**
 * Disturbed Slumber
 * {1}{G}
 * Instant — Common
 *
 * Until end of turn, target land you control becomes a 4/4 Dinosaur creature with reach and
 * haste. It's still a land. It must be blocked this turn if able.
 *
 * Two effects on resolution:
 *  1. [Effects.BecomeCreature] — Layer 4 adds CREATURE, Layer 4 sets subtypes to {Dinosaur},
 *     Layer 6 grants Reach + Haste, Layer 7b sets base P/T to 4/4. All revert at end of turn.
 *     LAND type is preserved (BecomeCreature does not strip it — "it's still a land").
 *  2. [MustBeBlockedEffect] — floating must-be-blocked requirement: the land-creature must be
 *     blocked this turn if able (one blocker is sufficient — `allCreatures = false`).
