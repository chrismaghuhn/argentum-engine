/**
 * Up the Beanstalk
 * {1}{G}
 * Enchantment
 *
 * When this enchantment enters and whenever you cast a spell with mana value 5 or greater,
 * draw a card.
 *
 * Printed as a single sentence, but it is two separate triggered abilities (CR 603.1) — an
 * enters trigger and a cast trigger — so it follows the repo's "enters or attacks" idiom of one
 * `triggeredAbility` block per condition. The cast trigger fires on *cast*, not on resolution,
 * so it still draws if the spell is countered.
