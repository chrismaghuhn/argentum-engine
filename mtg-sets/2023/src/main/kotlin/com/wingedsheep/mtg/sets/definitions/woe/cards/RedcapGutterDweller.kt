/**
 * Redcap Gutter-Dweller
 * {2}{R}{R}
 * Creature — Goblin Warrior
 * 3/3
 *
 * Menace
 * When this creature enters, create two 1/1 black Rat creature tokens with
 * "This token can't block."
 * At the beginning of your upkeep, you may sacrifice another creature. If you do,
 * put a +1/+1 counter on this creature and exile the top card of your library.
 * You may play that card this turn.
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 * - The upkeep trigger is an [Effects.MayPay]: the sacrifice is the optional
 *   cost (`excludeSource` enforces "another"), and paying it runs the counter +
 *   impulse rewards. Per the 2024-11-08 ruling, if Redcap leaves the battlefield
 *   before the trigger resolves, the sacrifice and impulse still happen — the
 *   [Effects.AddCounters] on the departed source simply no-ops while the rest of
 *   the composite continues.
