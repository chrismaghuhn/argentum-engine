/**
 * Savior of the Sleeping
 * {2}{W}
 * Creature — Human Knight
 * 2/3
 *
 * Vigilance
 * Whenever an enchantment you control is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, put a
 * +1/+1 counter on this creature.
 *
 * Same trigger shape as Wicked Visitor: any enchantment you control hitting the graveyard from
 * the battlefield — destroyed, sacrificed, self-sacrificing (Hopeless Nightmare), or a Role token
 * falling off when replaced — so it uses the generic `leavesBattlefield` factory with an `ANY`
 * binding rather than the SELF-bound named constants.
