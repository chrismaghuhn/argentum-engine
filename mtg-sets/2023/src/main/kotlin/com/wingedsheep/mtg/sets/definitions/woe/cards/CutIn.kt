/**
 * Cut In
 * {3}{R}
 * Sorcery
 *
 * Cut In deals 4 damage to target creature.
 * Create a Young Hero Role token attached to up to one target creature you control.
 *
 * Two independent targets: the mandatory "target creature" that takes 4 damage (any creature), and
 * the optional ("up to one") creature you control that gains the Young Hero Role. The Young Hero
 * Role token carries the attack trigger ("Whenever this creature attacks, if its toughness is 3 or
 * less, put a +1/+1 counter on it."); [Effects.CreateRoleToken] handles the "replace an existing
 * Role" rule. Same optional-role shape as Eriette's Whisper.
