/**
 * Relic's Roar
 * {U}
 * Instant — Common
 *
 * Until end of turn, target artifact or creature becomes a Dinosaur artifact creature with base
 * power and toughness 4/3 in addition to its other types.
 *
 * "In addition to its other types" means every added type is purely additive — the target keeps its
 * printed card types and subtypes. [Effects.BecomeCreature] adds the CREATURE type (Layer 4), adds
 * the ARTIFACT card type via [addTypes] (also Layer 4), and sets base P/T to 4/3 (Layer 7b), but its
 * `creatureTypes` parameter *replaces* all creature subtypes (SetCreatureSubtypes), which would strip
 * the printed subtypes (Centaur/Warrior). So the Dinosaur subtype is granted additively with a
 * separate [Effects.AddSubtype] (AddSubtype modification) instead. All revert at end of turn
 * (Duration.EndOfTurn). The target filter allows any artifact or creature.
