/**
 * Protective Parents
 * {2}{W}
 * Creature — Human Peasant
 * 3/2
 *
 * When this creature dies, create a Young Hero Role token attached to up to one target creature you
 * control. (If you control another Role on it, put that one into the graveyard. Enchanted creature
 * has "Whenever this creature attacks, if its toughness is 3 or less, put a +1/+1 counter on it.")
 *
 * "Up to one target" is optional targeting, so the trigger still resolves with no target chosen —
 * it just creates nothing (WOE ruling). The Parents themselves are in the graveyard by the time the
 * trigger resolves, so they're never a legal target; the same optional-role shape as Cut In.
