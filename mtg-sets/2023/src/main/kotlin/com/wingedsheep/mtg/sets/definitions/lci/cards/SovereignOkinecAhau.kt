/**
 * Sovereign Okinec Ahau — The Lost Caverns of Ixalan #240 (canonical printing)
 * {2}{G}{W} · Legendary Creature — Cat Noble · 3/4
 *
 * Ward {2}
 * Whenever Sovereign Okinec Ahau attacks, for each creature you control with power greater than
 * that creature's base power, put a number of +1/+1 counters on that creature equal to the
 * difference.
 *
 * Composed entirely from existing primitives — no bespoke effect:
 *  - **Ward {2}** — `KeywordAbility.Ward(WardCost.Mana("{2}"))`, the standard mana-ward idiom.
 *  - **The attack payoff** is `Triggers.self.attacks()` (SELF) driving an [Effects.ForEachInGroup] over
 *    `GroupFilter(GameObjectFilter.Creature.youControl().powerGreaterThanBase())` — the same
 *    self-relative `PowerGreaterThanBase` filter the Malamet cycle (Kutzil, Malamet Exemplar) uses,
 *    so a creature qualifies exactly when its current (projected) power exceeds its printed base.
 *    The group is snapshotted before any counters land, and the Sovereign itself is a member
 *    (it qualifies only if it is itself pumped above 3 power).
 *  - **The per-creature amount** is the "difference" the oracle names:
 *    `Subtract(EntityProperty(IterationEntity, Power), EntityProperty(IterationEntity, BasePower))`
 *    — current projected power minus that same creature's printed base power. The amount and the
 *    counters' target both name the creature currently being processed, so each qualifying
 *    creature receives counters equal to its *own* excess (measured at resolution). The
 *    `BasePower` numeric-property read matches the filter's base exactly, so the counter count is
 *    always ≥ 1 for every group member; a creature at power == base is never in the group, and a
 *    `*`/CDA-power creature (no fixed base) is excluded by the filter.
