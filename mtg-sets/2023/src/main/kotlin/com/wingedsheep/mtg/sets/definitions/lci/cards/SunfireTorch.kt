/**
 * Sunfire Torch (LCI #167) — {R} Artifact — Equipment (common)
 *
 * Equipped creature gets +1/+0 and has "Whenever this creature attacks, you may sacrifice
 * Sunfire Torch. When you do, this creature deals 2 damage to any target."
 * Equip {1}
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 * - The +1/+0 buff is a [ModifyStats] static scoped to [Filters.EquippedCreature].
 * - The quoted attack ability is granted to the equipped creature via [GrantTriggeredAbility]
 *   + `Triggers.<subject>.attacks(requires)` (SELF binding, the Pirate Hat / Dire Blunderbuss idiom), so it lives
 *   on the creature and fires when that creature attacks. The body is a [ReflexiveTriggerEffect]:
 *   the optional action sacrifices Sunfire Torch; only "when you do" puts the reflexive part on
 *   the stack to choose any target and deal 2 damage. The damage source defaults to the granted
 *   ability's source — the equipped creature — matching "this creature deals 2 damage."
 *
 * "sacrifice Sunfire Torch" — CR 201.5a: the name refers only to the specific granting
 * Equipment. A granted *triggered* ability resolves with the equipped creature as its source
 * (not the Equipment), so the sacrifice is scoped with `.attachedToSource()` to "the Sunfire
 * Torch attached to this creature" — i.e. the Equipment that granted the ability. With a second
 * Sunfire Torch elsewhere on the battlefield this correctly leaves it untouched (only the one
 * attached to the attacking creature is a legal sacrifice).
