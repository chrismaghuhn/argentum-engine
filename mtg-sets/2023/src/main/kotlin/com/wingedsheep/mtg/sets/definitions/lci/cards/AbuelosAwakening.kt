/**
 * Abuelo's Awakening
 * {X}{3}{W}
 * Sorcery — Rare — The Lost Caverns of Ixalan #1
 *
 * "Return target artifact or non-Aura enchantment card from your graveyard to the battlefield with
 *  X additional +1/+1 counters on it. It's a 1/1 Spirit creature with flying in addition to its
 *  other types."
 *
 * Resolution (CR 608.2) — a sequential composite, all as part of the spell resolving:
 *  1. [Effects.PutOntoBattlefield] moves the targeted card from the controller's graveyard to the
 *     battlefield. The target reference [t] is a `BoundVariable` whose entity ID is stable across the
 *     zone change (same pattern as Defossilize), so every later effect identifies the same permanent.
 *  2. [Effects.BecomeCreature] makes it a **1/1** creature with **flying**, permanently
 *     (`Duration.Permanent`). BecomeCreature always adds the CREATURE card type (Layer 4) and sets
 *     base P/T 1/1 (Layer 7b), leaving the reanimated card's printed artifact/enchantment types
 *     intact — "in addition to its other types."
 *  3. [Effects.AddSubtype] grants the **Spirit** subtype additively. BecomeCreature's `creatureTypes`
 *     parameter *replaces* all subtypes (SetCreatureSubtypes), which would strip the card's printed
 *     subtypes, so Spirit is added with a separate AddSubtype modification (same split as Relic's Roar).
 *  4. [Effects.AddDynamicCounters] puts **X** +1/+1 counters on it, where X is the spell's chosen
 *     {X} ([DynamicAmount.XValue]). Applied after it is already a creature so the counters count
 *     toward its power/toughness. Final stats: (1 + X) / (1 + X).
 *
 * The target filter accepts an artifact card, or an enchantment card that is not an Aura, owned by
 * the caster in their graveyard. Both branches share the ownedByYou gate, so the OR collapses to a
 * single CardPredicate.Or under the graveyard zone restriction.
