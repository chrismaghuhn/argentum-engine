/**
 * Jadelight Spelunker — {X}{G}
 * Creature — Merfolk Scout
 * 1/1
 * Rare — The Lost Caverns of Ixalan #196
 * Artist: Izzy
 *
 * "When this creature enters, it explores X times."
 *
 * X is the value paid for the spell's {X} generic mana, stamped onto the spell's xValue
 * and available in the ETB trigger context via [DynamicAmount.XValue] (CR 107.3a). The
 * trigger repeats the Explore mechanic (CR 701.44) exactly X times via
 * [RepeatDynamicTimesEffect]: each iteration reveals the top library card; a land goes to
 * hand, otherwise the Spelunker gets a +1/+1 counter and the player may put the card in
 * the graveyard. X=0 is legal and produces no explores.
