/**
 * Adaptive Gemguard
 * {3}{W}
 * Artifact Creature — Gnome
 * 3/3
 * Tap two untapped artifacts and/or creatures you control: Put a +1/+1 counter on this creature.
 * Activate only as a sorcery.
 *
 * The activation cost is "tap two untapped artifacts and/or creatures you control" (no "other"
 * restriction — Adaptive Gemguard itself can be tapped as one of the two).  This is modelled with
 * [Costs.TapPermanents] (the atomic `CostAtom.TapPermanents` primitive), which is exactly the right
 * shape for "tap N untapped permanents matching a filter as an ability cost".
