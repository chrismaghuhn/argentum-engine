/**
 * Warden of the Inner Sky
 * {W}
 * Creature — Human Soldier
 * 1/2
 *
 * As long as this creature has three or more counters on it, it has flying and vigilance.
 * Tap three untapped artifacts and/or creatures you control: Put a +1/+1 counter on this
 * creature. Scry 1. Activate only as a sorcery.
 *
 * The counter-threshold keyword grant is modeled as two conditional [staticAbility] blocks gated
 * on [Conditions.SourceCounterCountAtLeast] (same shape as Skyknight Squire) — one granting
 * FLYING, one granting VIGILANCE. Both apply only while the source carries 3+ counters, projected
 * through the layer system.
 *
 * The oracle text counts counters of *any* kind, so the threshold is gated on
 * `null`, which sums every counter kind on the source — a stun counter placed by
 * an opponent counts toward the three just like the +1/+1 counters from its own ability.
 *
 * The activation cost reuses the [Costs.TapPermanents] primitive (same shape as Sunshot Militia,
 * but count = 3): tap exactly three untapped artifacts and/or creatures you control (no "other"
 * restriction — Warden itself may be one of the three). The effect puts a +1/+1 counter on Warden
 * then scries 1, at sorcery speed.
