/**
 * Vito, Fanatic of Aclazotz — Lost Caverns of Ixalan #243
 * {2}{W}{B} · Legendary Creature — Vampire Demon · 4/4
 *
 * Flying
 * Whenever you sacrifice another permanent, you gain 2 life if this is the first time this ability
 * has resolved this turn. If it's the second time, each opponent loses 2 life. If it's the third
 * time, create a 4/3 white and black Vampire Demon creature token with flying.
 *
 * The "Victor template" — a single escalating triggered ability keyed to how many times *this
 * ability* has resolved this turn (cf. Victor, Valgavoth's Seneschal; Elrond, Lord of Rivendell).
 * The trigger fires per sacrificed permanent (`Triggers.you.sacrificesAnother(filter)`, per-permanent /
 * [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.TriggerBinding.OTHER] so the source sacrificing itself never fires
 * it). On each resolution it first bumps the source's per-turn resolution counter
 * ([IncrementAbilityResolutionCountEffect]) and then runs exactly one tier via
 * [Conditions.SourceAbilityResolvedNTimes] (== n). The increment must precede the conditionals or
 * the count is never read as 1/2/3. The 4th+ resolution this turn does nothing.
