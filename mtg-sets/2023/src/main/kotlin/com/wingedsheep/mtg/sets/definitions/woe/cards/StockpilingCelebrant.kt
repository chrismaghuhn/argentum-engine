/**
 * Stockpiling Celebrant
 * {2}{W}
 * Creature — Dwarf Knight
 * 3/2
 *
 * When this creature enters, you may return another target nonland permanent you control to its
 * owner's hand. If you do, scry 2.
 *
 * `optional = true` models the "you may" — declining skips the whole effect (no bounce, no scry).
 * The target is chosen when the trigger goes on the stack; if it becomes illegal before
 * resolution the ability has no legal target and is removed, so the "if you do" scry never fires.
 * When the player accepts, [Effects.Move] returns the permanent to its owner's hand and then
 * [Effects.Scry] follows.
