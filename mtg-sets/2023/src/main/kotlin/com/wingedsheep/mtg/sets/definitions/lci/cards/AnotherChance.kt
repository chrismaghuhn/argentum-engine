/**
 * Another Chance
 * {2}{B}
 * Instant — Common (LCI #90)
 *
 * "You may mill two cards. Then return up to two creature cards from your graveyard to your hand."
 *
 * Implementation:
 *  - [Effects.May] wrapping [Patterns.Library.mill] handles the optional mill of 2 cards; resolving
 *    with "no" skips the mill and proceeds to the return step.
 *  - Gather creature cards from the controller's graveyard, [SelectionMode.ChooseUpTo](2), then
 *    move selected cards to hand. Choosing 0 is valid ("up to two" = 0–2). An empty graveyard
 *    auto-skips the selection prompt (per [SelectFromCollectionExecutor] short-circuit).
