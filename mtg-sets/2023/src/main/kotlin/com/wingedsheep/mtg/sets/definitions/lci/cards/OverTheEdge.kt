/**
 * Over the Edge — {1}{G}
 * Sorcery
 * Common — The Lost Caverns of Ixalan #205
 * Artist: Ryan Valle
 *
 * "Choose one —
 *  • Destroy target artifact or enchantment.
 *  • Target creature you control explores, then it explores again."
 *
 * A "Choose one —" modal sorcery (CR 700.2 / 601.2b). Each mode declares its own target, so
 * targeting legality is checked per chosen mode at cast time.
 *
 * Mode 0: Destroy a targeted artifact or enchantment ([Targets.ArtifactOrEnchantment] matches a
 *   permanent that is an artifact and/or an enchantment).
 *
 * Mode 1: A creature you control explores twice (CR 701.44). "Explores, then it explores again"
 *   = two sequential [Effects.Explore] calls on the same permanent, mirroring Defossilize. Each
 *   explore reveals the top library card; a land goes to hand, otherwise a +1/+1 counter is put
 *   on the creature and the player may put the revealed card into the graveyard. The target [c]
 *   is a stable [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.targets.EffectTarget.BoundVariable] so both
 *   explores act on the same creature.
