/**
 * Song of Stupefaction
 * {1}{U}
 * Enchantment — Aura
 *
 * Enchant creature or Vehicle
 * When this Aura enters, you may mill two cards.
 * Fathomless descent — Enchanted permanent gets -X/-0, where X is the number of
 * permanent cards in your graveyard.
 *
 * The Aura attaches to a creature or Vehicle ([GameObjectFilter.CreatureOrVehicle], a Vehicle
 * matched by its subtype — same enchant clause as Silken Strength). The enters trigger is an
 * optional (`optional = true`) self-mill of two cards. The static power penalty is a
 * continuously recomputed [GrantDynamicStats] on the attached permanent: power is reduced
 * by the number of permanent cards in your graveyard (`Count(GRAVEYARD, Permanent)` negated via
 * `Multiply(..., -1)` — the "fathomless descent" count), toughness unchanged. The default
 * [GroupFilter.attachedCreature] scope is AttachedTo of any permanent, so the -X/-0 applies even
 * when the host is a non-creature Vehicle.
