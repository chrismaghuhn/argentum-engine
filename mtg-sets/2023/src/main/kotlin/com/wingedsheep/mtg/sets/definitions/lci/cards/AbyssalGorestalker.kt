/**
 * Abyssal Gorestalker
 * {4}{B}{B}
 * Creature — Horror
 * 6/6
 *
 * When this creature enters, each player sacrifices two creatures of their choice.
 *
 * `ForceSacrificeEffect` already names the players who must sacrifice, and `ForceSacrificeExecutor`
 * walks a multi-player reference itself — prompting each player in turn for their own two, and
 * auto-sacrificing without a prompt for anyone controlling two or fewer. So `Player.Each` goes
 * straight on the effect, which is what Barter in Blood, Blasphemous Edict, Bringer of the Last Gift
 * and By Invitation Only all write.
 *
 * This card used to wrap the same effect in a `ForEachPlayerEffect` over `Player.Each` with the
 * inner target left as the (rebound) controller — a hand-rolled restatement of the loop the executor
 * performs. Argentum Assay's differential is what reported the two spellings.
