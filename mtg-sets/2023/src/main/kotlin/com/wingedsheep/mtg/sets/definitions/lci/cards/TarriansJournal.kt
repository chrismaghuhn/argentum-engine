/**
 * Tarrian's Journal // The Tomb of Aclazotz — The Lost Caverns of Ixalan #126
 * {1}{B} · Legendary Artifact — Book
 * //  · Legendary Land — Cave
 *
 * Front — Tarrian's Journal:
 *   {T}, Sacrifice another artifact or creature: Draw a card. Activate only as a sorcery.
 *   {2}, {T}, Discard your hand: Transform Tarrian's Journal.
 *
 * Back — The Tomb of Aclazotz:
 *   {T}: Add {B}.
 *   {T}: You may cast a creature spell from your graveyard this turn. If you do, it enters with a
 *   finality counter on it and is a Vampire in addition to its other types.
 *
 * The transform is a plain in-place flip (`TransformEffect`, CR 701.27) — not an exile-return — so
 * `CardDefinition.doubleFacedPermanent` (artifact front, non-creature land back). The back's second
 * ability grants `MayCastFromGraveyard(Creature)` for the turn (the already-wired graveyard-cast
 * permission), carrying a cast-this-way **entry rider**: a creature cast from the graveyard under
 * this grant enters with a finality counter and gains Vampire "in addition to its other types". The
 * rider is frozen onto the cast spell at cast time (`CastSpellHandler` reads the authorizing
 * `MayCastFromGraveyard` grant) and applied when it resolves onto the battlefield (`StackResolver`
 * → `EntersWithReplacements.applyCastFromGraveyardRider`): the counter is placed (the finality
 * death-replacement in `ZoneMovementUtils` then exiles it instead of dying) and the added subtype is
 * a floating `Layer.TYPE` effect that lasts while the permanent is on the battlefield.
