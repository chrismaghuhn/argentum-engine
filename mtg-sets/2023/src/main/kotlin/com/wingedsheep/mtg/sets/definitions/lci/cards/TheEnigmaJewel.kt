/**
 * The Enigma Jewel // Locus of Enlightenment (CR 702.167, The Lost Caverns of Ixalan, #55)
 * {U}
 * Legendary Artifact // Legendary Artifact
 *
 * Front face — The Enigma Jewel ({U}, Legendary Artifact)
 *   The Enigma Jewel enters tapped.
 *   {T}: Add {C}{C}. Spend this mana only to activate abilities.
 *   Craft with four or more nonlands with activated abilities {8}{U}
 *
 * Back face — Locus of Enlightenment (Legendary Artifact)
 *   Locus of Enlightenment has each activated ability of the exiled cards used to craft it.
 *   You may activate each of those abilities only once each turn.
 *   Whenever you activate an ability that isn't a mana ability, copy it. You may choose new
 *   targets for the copy.
 *
 * Implementation (fully built from composable primitives — no card-specific engine code):
 *  - "Enters tapped" is the [EntersTapped] enters-the-battlefield replacement effect.
 *  - The mana ability is [Effects.AddColorlessMana] (2) carrying
 *    [ManaRestriction.AbilityActivationOnly] — the pool-level spend check accepts any ability
 *    activation (of any source) and rejects spell casts and special actions.
 *  - The **craft** ability is the `craft(...)` DSL over the material filter
 *    `GameObjectFilter.Nonland.withCardPredicate(CardPredicate.HasActivatedAbility)` — "four or
 *    more nonlands with activated abilities" (CR 702.167a/b; the material pool spans battlefield
 *    permanents you control and cards in your graveyard, and `HasActivatedAbility` counts mana
 *    abilities too, so a mana rock/dork qualifies).
 *  - The back face's **ability grant** is the [HasAllActivatedAbilitiesOfCards] static with
 *    `source = CRAFTED` and `oncePerTurnEach = true` (CR 702.167c): the Locus has each activated
 *    ability of the cards exiled to craft it, each usable only once each turn (tracked per exiled
 *    card — two exiled copies of one card each get their own budget). `{T}` costs tap the Locus and
 *    self-references bind to it (CR 113.7 — a granted ability's source is the object that has it).
 *  - The back face's **copy clause** is `Triggers.you.activatesAbility()` (fires for every activated
 *    ability you activate that isn't a mana ability, CR 605.1a) paired with
 *    [Effects.CopyTargetSpellOrAbility] against [EffectTarget.TriggeringEntity]: the triggering
 *    entity of an `AbilityActivatedEvent` is the activated ability already on the stack, and the
 *    copy executor reprompts for new targets (CR 707.10c) or copies a no-target ability without a
 *    prompt. The copy is pushed with `emitActivationEvent = false`, so it doesn't re-trigger the
 *    clause and doesn't consume another once-each-turn activation.
