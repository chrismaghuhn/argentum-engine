/**
 * Ashiok's Reaper
 * {3}{B}
 * Creature — Nightmare
 * 3/3
 *
 * Whenever an enchantment you control is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, draw a card.
 *
 * Same trigger shape as Warehouse Tabby: any enchantment you control hitting the graveyard from
 * the battlefield — destroyed, sacrificed, or a Role token falling off when it's replaced — so it
 * uses the generic `leavesBattlefield` factory with an `ANY` binding rather than a SELF-bound
 * constant. Role tokens count: per the WOE ruling, an enchantment token is put into its owner's
 * graveyard before it ceases to exist, so the Reaper sees it.
