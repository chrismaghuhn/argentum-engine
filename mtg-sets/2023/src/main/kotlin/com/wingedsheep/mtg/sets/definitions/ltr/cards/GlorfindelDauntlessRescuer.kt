/**
 * Glorfindel, Dauntless Rescuer
 * {2}{G}
 * Legendary Creature — Elf Noble
 * 3/2
 *
 * Whenever you scry, choose one and Glorfindel gets +1/+1 until end of turn.
 * • Glorfindel must be blocked this turn if able.
 * • Glorfindel can't be blocked by more than one creature each combat this turn.
 *
 * The +1/+1 always happens (it sits before the bullet list), so it is folded into each mode
 * (exactly one mode is chosen → +1/+1 once). Mode 1 = `MustBeBlockedEffect(Self, allCreatures =
 * false)` ("must be blocked if able"); mode 2 grants `AbilityFlag.CANT_BE_BLOCKED_BY_MORE_THAN_ONE`
 * for the turn.
