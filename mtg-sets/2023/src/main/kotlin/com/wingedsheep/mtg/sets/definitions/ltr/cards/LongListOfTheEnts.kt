/**
 * Long List of the Ents
 * {G}
 * Enchantment — Saga (6 chapters)
 *
 * (As this Saga enters and after your draw step, add a lore counter. Sacrifice after VI.)
 * I, II, III, IV, V, VI — Note a creature type that hasn't been noted for this Saga.
 * When you next cast a creature spell of that type this turn, that creature enters with
 * an additional +1/+1 counter on it.
 *
 * Each chapter does two things in sequence:
 *  1. `NoteCreatureType("notedType")` — prompts the controller for a creature type not
 *     already noted on this Saga, persisting the pick to its `NotedCreatureTypesComponent`
 *     and stashing it under `chosenValues["notedType"]` for the next pipeline step. The
 *     dedup is the heart of the card: each chapter has to pick a *different* type.
 *  2. `CreateDelayedTriggerEffect` — installs a one-shot, end-of-turn delayed triggered
 *     ability whose `SpellCastEvent` filter is `Creature.withSubtypeFromVariable("notedType")`.
 *     `CreateDelayedTriggerExecutor.bakeChosenValuesIntoTrigger` substitutes the
 *     just-noted type into the filter at trigger-creation time, because the
 *     EffectContext that holds chosenValues is gone by the time the trigger fires. When
 *     a matching creature spell is cast that turn, the trigger fires and adds a +1/+1
 *     counter to the spell on the stack via `EffectTarget.TriggeringEntity`; the counter
 *     travels with the spell to the battlefield as it resolves, satisfying "enters with
 *     an additional +1/+1 counter on it" naturally.
 *
 * Up to six different noted types can be active simultaneously by the time chapter VI
 * resolves (one delayed trigger per chapter), each watching for a different creature type.
 * Each is one-shot — at most one matching cast per type per chapter consumes its trigger.
