/**
 * The Skullspore Nexus {6}{G}{G}
 * Legendary Artifact
 *
 * This spell costs {X} less to cast, where X is the greatest power among creatures you control.
 * Whenever one or more nontoken creatures you control die, create a green Fungus Dinosaur creature
 * token with base power and toughness each equal to the total power of those creatures.
 * {2}, {T}: Double target creature's power until end of turn.
 *
 * Modeled per the Comprehensive Rules and Scryfall rulings:
 *  - Cost reduction: a self-cost [ModifySpellCost] with the
 *    [CostReductionSource.GreatestPropertyAmongPermanentsYouControl] (`EntityNumericProperty.Power`)
 *    dynamic source over creatures you
 *    control. Read from projected state, so a creature whose power is defined by another value
 *    (e.g. cards in hand) contributes its current power. Cannot reduce the {G}{G} pips or go below 0.
 *  - Death trigger: a batched `Triggers.oneOrMore(filter).die()` over *nontoken* creatures
 *    (CR 603.2c — fires once per death batch, not once per creature). The token's base power and
 *    toughness are both [DynamicAmounts.diedBatchTotalPower], the summed *last-known* power of the
 *    nontoken creatures that died (ruling 2023-11-10: "as they last existed on the battlefield").
 *  - Double power: `+X/+0` where X is the target's power as the ability resolves
 *    (ruling 2023-11-10), i.e. [DynamicAmounts.targetPower] for power and a fixed 0 toughness.
