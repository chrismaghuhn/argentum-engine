/**
 * Sage of Days
 * {2}{U}
 * Creature — Human Wizard
 * 3/2
 *
 * When this creature enters, look at the top three cards of your library. You may put one of those
 * cards back on top of your library. Put the rest into your graveyard.
 *
 * Pipeline (surveil-style keep-one-on-top dig; the look is private — no reveal):
 *   1. GatherCards(TopOfLibrary(3)) → "looked"          — pulled off the library so the controller
 *                                                          sees them privately during selection.
 *   2. SelectFromCollection("looked", ChooseUpTo(1))     — the optional "you may put one back on top".
 *        storeSelected = "toTop", storeRemainder = "toGraveyard"
 *   3. MoveCollection("toTop"       → LIBRARY, Top)       — the kept card returns to the top.
 *   4. MoveCollection("toGraveyard" → GRAVEYARD)          — everything not kept is put into the yard.
 *
 * ChooseUpTo(1) honors the "may" — the controller can keep zero (all three go to the graveyard).
 * If the library has fewer than three cards, the gather simply collects what's there.
