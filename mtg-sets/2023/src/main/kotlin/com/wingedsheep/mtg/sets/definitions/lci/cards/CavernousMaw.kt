/**
 * Cavernous Maw
 * Land — Cave (LCI #270, uncommon)
 *
 * {T}: Add {C}.
 * {2}: This land becomes a 3/3 Elemental creature until end of turn. It's still a Cave land.
 *   Activate only if the number of other Caves you control plus the number of Cave cards in
 *   your graveyard is three or greater.
 *
 * The animate is the standard "Restless"/creature-land shape ([RestlessRidgeline],
 * [TendrilOfTheMycotyrant]): a self-targeting [Effects.BecomeCreature] with base 3/3, creature
 * type Elemental, `Duration.EndOfTurn`. It keeps its existing types — no `removeTypes` — so it
 * stays a Land with the Cave subtype ("It's still a Cave land"), and stays colorless (no `colors`).
 *
 * The activation gate is an [ActivationRestriction.OnlyIfCondition] comparing a composite count to
 * three (CR 205.3i cave subtype). The count sums two [DynamicAmount]s:
 *   - **other Caves you control** — [DynamicAmount.AggregateBattlefield] with `excludeSelf = true`,
 *     so the Maw itself is not counted among the Caves it controls (the "other" in the oracle).
 *   - **Cave cards in your graveyard** — [DynamicAmount.Count] over [Zone.GRAVEYARD]
 *     ([GameObjectFilter.Any] with the Cave subtype, since graveyard cards aren't restricted to lands).
 * The activation-restriction check evaluates the condition with the Maw as the effect source
 * (`LegalityKernel.activationRestrictionFailure`), so `excludeSelf` resolves against the Maw.
