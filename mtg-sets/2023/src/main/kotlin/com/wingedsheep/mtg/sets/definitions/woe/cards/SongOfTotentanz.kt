 * Create X 1/1 black Rat creature tokens with "This token can't block."

 *
 * The two halves are ordered, not simultaneous: the Rats are created first, so the haste grant —
 * a `ForEachInGroup` over creatures you control, snapshotted at resolution — catches them too.
 * Creatures that arrive later in the turn don't get haste (WOE ruling), which falls out of the
 * group being enumerated once, at resolution.
