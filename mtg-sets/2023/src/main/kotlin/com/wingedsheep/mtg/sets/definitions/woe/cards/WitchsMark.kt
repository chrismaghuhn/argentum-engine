/**
 * Witch's Mark
 * {1}{R}
 * Sorcery
 *
 * You may discard a card. If you do, draw two cards.
 * Create a Wicked Role token attached to up to one target creature you control.
 *
 * Two independent halves, and only the second one targets. "Up to one target" is optional
 * targeting, so the spell is castable with no target at all — you then just loot (2023-09-01
 * ruling). If you *do* pick a target and it's illegal on resolution, the spell doesn't resolve
 * and **none** of its effects happen: no discard, no draw, no Role. That all-or-nothing fizzle
 * is the engine's ordinary targeting behavior (CR 608.2b), so the two halves can sit in a plain
 * [Effects.Composite] rather than being separated.
 *
 * The loot half is the [Effects.May] + [Effects.IfYouDo] shape: declining the "may" skips the draw,
 * and so does an empty hand — the discard accomplishes nothing, so the `ifYouDo` never fires.
 * The one-Role-per-creature rule (a state-based action) lives behind [Effects.CreateRoleToken].
