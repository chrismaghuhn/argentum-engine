/**
 * Unassuming Sage
 * {1}{W}
 * Creature — Human Peasant Wizard
 * 2/2
 *
 * When this creature enters, you may pay {2}. If you do, create a Sorcerer Role token attached
 * to it. (Enchanted creature gets +1/+1 and has "Whenever this creature attacks, scry 1.")
 *
 * "Attached to it" points back at the Sage, not at a target — the trigger is untargeted, so
 * hexproof/shroud never enter into it and there's nothing to fizzle. [Effects.MayPay] models
 * "you may pay {2}. If you do" as one step: declining, or being unable to produce the mana,
 * simply skips the Role. If the Sage has left the battlefield by the time the trigger resolves,
 * there's no legal host and the Role isn't created.
