 * (If you control another Role on it, put that one into the graveyard. Enchanted creature gets
 * +1/+1 and has trample.)

 * The +2/+0 comes from the spell; the +1/+1 and trample come from the Monster Role token itself,
 * so the spell only pumps and creates the Role (Role replacement is handled by the executor).
