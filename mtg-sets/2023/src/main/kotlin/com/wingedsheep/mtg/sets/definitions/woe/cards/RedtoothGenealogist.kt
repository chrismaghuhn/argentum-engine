/**
 * Redtooth Genealogist
 * {2}{G}
 * Creature — Elf Advisor
 * 2/3
 *
 * When this creature enters, create a Royal Role token attached to another target creature you
 * control. (If you control another Role on it, put that one into the graveyard. Enchanted creature
 * gets +1/+1 and has ward {1}.)
 *
 * "Another target creature you control" — the Genealogist can't crown itself, hence
 * [Targets.OtherCreatureYouControl] rather than the plain creature-you-control filter. With no
 * other creature on board the trigger simply has no legal target and is removed from the stack.
 * The one-Role-per-creature rule lives behind [Effects.CreateRoleToken].
