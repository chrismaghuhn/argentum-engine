/**
 * Throne of the Grim Captain // The Grim Captain (CR 702.167, The Lost Caverns of Ixalan #266)
 * {2}
 * Legendary Artifact // Legendary Creature — Skeleton Spirit Pirate
 *
 * Front face — Throne of the Grim Captain ({2}, Legendary Artifact)
 *   {T}: Mill two cards.
 *   Craft with a Dinosaur, a Merfolk, a Pirate, and a Vampire {4}
 *
 * Back face — The Grim Captain (Legendary Creature — Skeleton Spirit Pirate, 7/7)
 *   Menace, trample, lifelink, hexproof
 *   Whenever The Grim Captain attacks, each opponent sacrifices a nonland permanent of
 *   their choice. Then you may put an exiled creature card used to craft The Grim Captain
 *   onto the battlefield under your control tapped and attacking.
 *
 * Fully implemented from composable primitives — the two mechanics the printed card needs beyond
 * the existing craft/pipeline vocabulary were added as reusable SDK/engine features:
 *  - **Heterogeneous slot-based Craft** — the front `craft(slots = ...)` overload. This craft names
 *    one material of *each* of four subtypes, so validating a chosen set is a bipartite
 *    perfect-matching problem (a single Merfolk Pirate fills only one slot; four Vampires cannot
 *    cover Dinosaur/Merfolk/Pirate/Vampire). `AbilityCost.Craft.slots` carries the per-slot filters
 *    and `CraftSlotMatching` (engine) does the matching in `canPay`, the legal-action enumerator,
 *    and payment. The union of the slots stays in `filter`, so the flat BF+GY candidate gathering
 *    and the client's material overlay work unchanged.
 *  - **`CardSource.CraftedMaterials`** — the gather-pipeline twin of `DonorCards.CRAFT_MATERIALS`,
 *    reading the source's `CraftedFromExiledComponent` (the cards exiled to craft it) filtered to
 *    those still in exile. It powers the attack trigger's second sentence.
 *
 * Wiring:
 *  - Front tap ability: [Costs.Tap] + [Patterns.Library.mill] (2).
 *  - Back-face keywords: menace, trample, lifelink, hexproof as plain [Keyword]s.
 *  - Back-face attack trigger (`Triggers.self.attacks()`) is one [Effects.Composite]:
 *      1. `Effects.Sacrifice(NonlandPermanent, EachOpponent)` — the edict; each opponent chooses
 *         their own nonland permanent (Tithing Blade's shape, widened to nonland permanent).
 *      2. gather [CardSource.CraftedMaterials] → [SelectionMode.ChooseUpTo] `1` filtered to
 *         [GameObjectFilter.Creature] ("you may ... an exiled creature card") → move to
 *         [Zone.BATTLEFIELD] with [ZonePlacement.TappedAndAttacking] under your control (Gishath's
 *         "put ... onto the battlefield tapped and attacking" shape).
 *  - Back-face color: the printed back has a black COLOR INDICATOR (empty mana cost), modelled with
 *    `colorIndicator = "B"` (CR 204) so the projected face actually reads as black — not the older
 *    `colorIdentity`-only approximation that left it colourless.
 *
 * Note on client UX for the heterogeneous craft: the legal action ships the *union* of the four
 * slots as one flat material list with min = max = 4, so the overlay lets you pick any four
 * eligible cards. The engine rejects a four-card set that can't fill each distinct slot (e.g. four
 * Vampires) at payment time. Per-slot selection UI is intentionally not added for this one card.
