 * Destroy up to one target artifact, enchantment, or creature with flying. Create a Food token.

 * The target filter is a heterogeneous OR — any artifact, any enchantment, OR a creature that has
 * flying (the flying restriction binds only to the creature branch). The target is optional
 * ("up to one"), so the spell still resolves and creates the Food even with no legal/chosen target.
