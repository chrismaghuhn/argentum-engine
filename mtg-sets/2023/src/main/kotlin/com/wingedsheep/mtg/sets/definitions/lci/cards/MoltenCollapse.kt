/**
 * Molten Collapse
 * {B}{R}
 * Sorcery
 *
 * Choose one. If you descended this turn, you may choose both instead. (You descended if a
 * permanent card was put into your graveyard from anywhere.)
 * • Destroy target creature or planeswalker.
 * • Destroy target noncreature, nonland permanent with mana value 1 or less.
 *
 * The conditional modal count is a cast-time `dynamicChooseCount`, exactly the Flame of Anor
 * pattern: the floor stays `minChooseCount = 1` ("choose one" is mandatory), and the cap is 2
 * when you descended this turn (CR 700.11 — a permanent card was put into your graveyard from
 * anywhere), otherwise 1. Evaluated against the game state at cast time by
 * [com.wingedsheep.engine.handlers.actions.spell.CastSpellHandler].
 *
 * Mode 1's target is "creature or planeswalker" ([Targets.CreatureOrPlaneswalker]); mode 2's
 * target is a nonland permanent that is not a creature with mana value 1 or less.
