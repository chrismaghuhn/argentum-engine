/**
 * Tom Bombadil
 * {W}{U}{B}{R}{G}
 * Legendary Creature — God Bard
 * 4/4
 *
 * As long as there are four or more lore counters among Sagas you control, Tom Bombadil has
 * hexproof and indestructible.
 * Whenever the final chapter ability of a Saga you control resolves, reveal cards from the top
 * of your library until you reveal a Saga card. Put that card onto the battlefield and the rest
 * on the bottom of your library in a random order. This ability triggers only once each turn.
 *
 * The static gate uses [Conditions.CounterKindAmongYouControlAtLeast] to sum lore counters across
 * Sagas you control (CR 714 lore counters), and a ConditionalStaticAbility granting hexproof +
 * indestructible to itself. The trigger fires on `Triggers.you.sagaChapterResolves(true)`
 * (`oncePerTurn`) and composes GatherUntilMatch (until a Saga, from your library) + RevealCollection
 * + two filtered MoveCollections: the Saga → your battlefield, the rest → the bottom of your library
 * in random order.
