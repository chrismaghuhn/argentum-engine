/**
 * Subterranean Schooner
 * {1}{U}
 * Artifact — Vehicle
 * 3/4
 *
 * Whenever this Vehicle attacks, target creature that crewed it this turn explores. (Reveal the top
 * card of your library. Put that card into your hand if it's a land. Otherwise, put a +1/+1 counter
 * on that creature, then put the card back or put it into your graveyard.)
 * Crew 1
 *
 * The attack trigger targets a creature restricted to the ones that crewed this Vehicle this turn
 * via the source-relative `crewedOrSaddledSourceThisTurn` filter (backed by the engine's
 * CrewSaddleContributorsComponent). That same targeted creature explores (CR 701.44), so the
 * potential +1/+1 counter lands on the crewer, matching the oracle "put a +1/+1 counter on that
 * creature".
