/**
 * Tithing Blade // Consuming Sepulcher (CR 702.167, The Lost Caverns of Ixalan)
 * {1}{B}
 * Artifact // Artifact
 *
 * Front face — Tithing Blade ({1}{B}, Artifact)
 *   When this artifact enters, each opponent sacrifices a creature of their choice.
 *   Craft with creature {4}{B} ({4}{B}, Exile this artifact, Exile a creature you
 *   control or a creature card from your graveyard: Return this card transformed
 *   under its owner's control. Craft only as a sorcery.)
 *
 * Back face — Consuming Sepulcher (Artifact)
 *   At the beginning of your upkeep, each opponent loses 1 life and you gain 1 life.
 *
 * Implementation:
 *  - ETB edict: `Triggers.self.enters()` + `Effects.Sacrifice` aimed at
 *    [Player.EachOpponent] — each opponent chooses their own creature to sacrifice
 *    (same shape as Susurian Dirgecraft / Cabal Executioner).
 *  - Craft: the `craft(...)` DSL helper wires the activated ability with an
 *    [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.AbilityCost.Craft] material cost (exactly one
 *    creature: `minCount = maxCount = 1`, drawn from battlefield-controlled creatures
 *    and/or creature cards in your graveyard per CR 702.167b) plus the {4}{B} mana
 *    portion; resolution returns the card transformed via
 *    [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.effects.ReturnSelfFromExileTransformedEffect].
 *  - Back-face drain: `Triggers.you.beginningOf(Step.UPKEEP)` + composite of `Effects.LoseLife(1)` on
 *    [Player.EachOpponent] and `Effects.GainLife(1)` for the controller.
