 * activated.

 * Pacifism's combat lock (CantAttack/CantBlock scoped to the attached permanent) plus
 * the Cursed Totem-style activation lock narrowed to just this Aura's host via
 * [PreventActivatedAbilities] with `attachedToBySource()`. `GroupFilter.attachedCreature()`
 * is actually a plain `Permanent` filter scoped to the attached object, so it correctly
 * covers an artifact host as well as a creature.
