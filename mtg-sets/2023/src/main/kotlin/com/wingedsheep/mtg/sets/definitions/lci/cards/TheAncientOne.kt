/**
 * The Ancient One
 * {U}{B}
 * Legendary Creature — Spirit God
 * 8/8
 *
 * Descend 8 — The Ancient One can't attack or block unless there are eight or more
 * permanent cards in your graveyard.
 * {2}{U}{B}: Draw a card, then discard a card. When you discard a card this way, target
 * player mills cards equal to its mana value.
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 *  - Descend 8 is modeled as two [ConditionalStaticAbility] gates — a [CantAttack] and a
 *    [CantBlock] on the source — that apply while the restriction is in force, i.e. while you
 *    have FEWER than eight permanent cards in your graveyard
 *    (`Not(CardsInGraveyardMatchingAtLeast(8, Permanent))`). Once eight-or-more permanent cards
 *    are in your graveyard the conditions are false and both restrictions lift. Mirrors Basking
 *    Capybara's Descend gate, but with combat-restriction statics instead of a stat buff.
 *  - The activated ability draws, then runs a discard pipeline whose selected card is stashed in
 *    the `discarded` collection ([Patterns.Hand.discardCards] → `storeSelected = "discarded"`).
 *    "When you discard a card this way" is a [ReflexiveTriggerEffect] (optional = false: the
 *    discard is mandatory) that targets a player after the discard resolves and mills them equal
 *    to the discarded card's mana value. The reflexive effect reads the discarded card's mana
 *    value via [DynamicAmount.StoredCardManaValue] — evaluated by entity id, so it is correct
 *    even though the card has already moved to the graveyard. Milling zero (e.g. a discarded
 *    land) still requires and uses a target player, matching the oracle wording.
