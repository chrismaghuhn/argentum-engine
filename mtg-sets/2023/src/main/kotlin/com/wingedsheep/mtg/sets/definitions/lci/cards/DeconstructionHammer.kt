/**
 * Deconstruction Hammer (LCI #9) — {W} Artifact — Equipment (common)
 *
 * Equipped creature gets +1/+1 and has "{3}, {T}, Sacrifice Deconstruction Hammer:
 * Destroy target artifact or enchantment."
 * Equip {1}
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 * - The +1/+1 buff is a [ModifyStats] static scoped to [Filters.EquippedCreature].
 * - The quoted activated ability is granted to the equipped creature via
 *   [GrantActivatedAbility] (the Swashbuckler's Whip idiom): it lives on the creature, its
 *   `{T}` taps that creature (the granted ability's source, CR 113.7), and the mana +
 *   sacrifice are paid by that creature's controller. [Effects.Destroy] hits the ability's
 *   sole target ([Targets.ArtifactOrEnchantment]).
 * - "Sacrifice Deconstruction Hammer" refers only to the specific granting Equipment
 *   (CR 201.5a), so the cost is [Costs.SacrificeGrantingPermanent], which sacrifices exactly
 *   the granter resolved at activation time — no name filter, no target prompt, and correct
 *   with a second Deconstruction Hammer on the battlefield.
