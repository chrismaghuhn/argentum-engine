/**
 * Uchbenbak, the Great Mistake
 * {3}{U}{B}
 * Legendary Creature — Skeleton Horror
 * 6/4
 *
 * Vigilance, menace
 * Descend 8 — {4}{U}{B}: Return this card from your graveyard to the battlefield with a finality
 * counter on it. Activate only if there are eight or more permanent cards in your graveyard and
 * only as a sorcery. (If a creature with a finality counter on it would die, exile it instead.)
 *
 * The Descend 8 ability is a graveyard-zone activated ability (`activateFromZone = Zone.GRAVEYARD`),
 * gated on eight-or-more permanent cards in your graveyard
 * ([Conditions.CardsInGraveyardMatchingAtLeast] with [GameObjectFilter.Permanent]) and restricted
 * to sorcery speed ([TimingRule.SorcerySpeed]). It returns this card to the battlefield and drops a
 * finality counter on it, mirroring Balustrade Wurm's Delirium reanimation (Move Self
 * GRAVEYARD→BATTLEFIELD, then [AddCountersEffect] on Self). The finality counter's die-replacement
 * (exile instead) is the engine-wide behavior of [CounterType.FINALITY].
