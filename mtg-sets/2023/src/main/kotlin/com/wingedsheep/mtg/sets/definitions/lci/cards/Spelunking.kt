/**
 * Spelunking — {2}{G} Enchantment.
 *
 * - ETB: "draw a card, then you may put a land card from your hand onto the battlefield. If you put
 *   a Cave onto the battlefield this way, you gain 4 life." Composed as
 *   Draw → [Patterns.Hand.putFromHand] (Gather hand lands → Select up to 1 → Move to battlefield;
 *   the "up to 1" models the "you may" — the player can decline or have no land) → a
 *   [ConditionalOnCollectionEffect] gate over the pipeline's `"putting"` collection restricted to
 *   the Cave subtype, the exact "if the moved card is a X" shape used by connive / Cauldron Dance.
 *   The life gain only fires when a Cave was actually put this way.
 * - "Lands you control enter untapped." — a static [EntersUntapped] replacement consulted from the
 *   battlefield whenever a land its controller controls would enter tapped (the inverse of
 *   [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.EntersTapped], per The Wandering Minstrel). Per CR 616.1 the
 *   affected land's controller chooses the replacement order — and since this affects only "lands
 *   you control", that chooser is Spelunking's controller, who always applies "enters untapped"
 *   last, so it wins over a land's own "enters tapped" replacement. A land merely put onto the
 *   battlefield tapped (no replacement) enters untapped instead.
