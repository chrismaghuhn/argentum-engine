/**
 * Twists and Turns // Mycoid Maze (The Lost Caverns of Ixalan)
 * {G}
 * Enchantment // Land — Cave
 *
 * Front — Twists and Turns (Enchantment, {G})
 *   If a creature you control would explore, instead you scry 1, then that creature explores.
 *   When this enchantment enters, target creature you control explores.
 *   When a land you control enters, if you control seven or more lands, transform this enchantment.
 *
 * Back — Mycoid Maze (Land — Cave)
 *   {T}: Add {G}.
 *   {3}{G}, {T}: Look at the top four cards of your library. You may reveal a creature card from
 *   among them and put that card into your hand. Put the rest on the bottom of your library in a
 *   random order.
 *
 * Implementation:
 *  - The explore-modifying clause is a [ModifyKeywordAction] replacement (CR 614): "if a creature you
 *    control would explore, first [Effects.Scry] 1, then it explores." `ExploreEffectExecutor`
 *    consults it and re-issues the explore as a Composite so the scry's top/bottom decision
 *    resolves before the explore.
 *  - ETB is `Triggers.self.enters()` → [Effects.Explore] on a target creature you control; the
 *    replacement applies to that explore too (scry 1 first).
 *  - The transform is `Triggers.a(GameObjectFilter.Land.youControl()).enters()` with intervening-if
 *    [Conditions.YouControlAtLeast]`(7, Land)` → [TransformEffect].
 *  - Back's activated ability is [Patterns.Library.lookAtTopRevealMatchingToHand] (count 4,
 *    creature, rest to the bottom in random order).
