/**
 * Didact Echo

 * Creature — Spirit Cleric
 * 3/2
 *
 * When this creature enters, draw a card.
 * Descend 4 — This creature has flying as long as there are four or more permanent cards
 * in your graveyard.
 *
 * The ETB trigger is unconditional — it always draws a card when Didact Echo enters the
 * battlefield.
 *
 * The Descend 4 static ability is modelled as a [ConditionalStaticAbility] wrapping a
 * [GrantKeyword](FLYING) over [GroupFilter.source()], gated by
 * [Conditions.CardsInGraveyardMatchingAtLeast](4, Permanent). The condition is re-evaluated
 * continuously in Layer 6, so flying appears and disappears as the graveyard count changes.
