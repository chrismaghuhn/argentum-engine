/**
 * Amalia Benavides Aguirre — {W}{B}
 * Legendary Creature — Vampire Scout
 * 2/2
 *
 * Ward—Pay 3 life.
 * Whenever you gain life, Amalia Benavides Aguirre explores. Then destroy all other
 * creatures if its power is exactly 20.
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 *
 * **Ward—Pay 3 life:** `KeywordAbility.Ward(WardCost.Life(3))`. When an opponent
 * targets Amalia, they must pay 3 life or the spell/ability is countered (CR 702.21).
 *
 * **YouGainLife trigger:** Fires once per life-gain event (`Triggers.you.gainsLife()`).
 * The triggered effect is a sequential `Composite`:
 *
 * 1. `Effects.Explore(EffectTarget.Self)` — Amalia explores (CR 701.44): reveal the top
 *    card of your library; a land goes to your hand (no counter); a nonland puts a +1/+1
 *    counter on Amalia and gives the controller the option to put the card in the graveyard.
 *
 * 2. `Effects.If(Conditions.SourceMatches(GameObjectFilter.Creature.power(20)), ...)` —
 *    AFTER explore completes, check Amalia's projected power. If exactly 20, destroy all
 *    other creatures. `Patterns.Group.destroyAll(GroupFilter(GameObjectFilter.Creature,
 *    excludeSelf = true))` gathers every creature on the battlefield except the source
 *    (Amalia) and destroys each.
 *
 * Ordering is rules-faithful: explore runs first and may change Amalia's power via a
 * +1/+1 counter; the power-20 check reads the post-explore projected power.
