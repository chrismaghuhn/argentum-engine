/**
 * Imodane's Recruiter // Train Troops
 * {2}{R}
 * Creature — Human Knight
 * 2/2
 *
 * When this creature enters, creatures you control get +1/+0 and gain haste until end of turn.
 *
 * Adventure: Train Troops — {4}{W}, Sorcery — Adventure
 * Create two 2/2 white Knight creature tokens with vigilance.
 *
 * (CR 715: Adventure cards. Casting the Adventure exiles the card on resolution and lets the caster
 * cast it as the creature spell while it remains in exile.)
 *
 * The ETB pump is a `ForEachInGroup` over creatures you control, enumerated once at resolution —
 * the Recruiter itself is included, and creatures that arrive later in the turn are not (WOE
 * ruling). Both halves of the grant are `EndOfTurn`-duration and target the iteration entity.
