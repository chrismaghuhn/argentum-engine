/**
 * Wail of the Forgotten
 * {U}{B}
 * Sorcery
 *
 * Descend 8 — Choose one. If there are eight or more permanent cards in your graveyard as you
 * cast this spell, choose one or more instead.
 * • Return target nonland permanent to its owner's hand.
 * • Target opponent discards a card.
 * • Look at the top three cards of your library. Put one of them into your hand and the rest into
 *   your graveyard.
 *
 * Descend 8 raises the modal count as a cast-time `dynamicChooseCount`, the same shape as Molten
 * Collapse's descend gate (which itself follows the Flame of Anor pattern). The floor stays
 * `minChooseCount = 1` ("choose one" is mandatory); the cap rises to all three distinct modes when
 * there are eight or more permanent cards in your graveyard as you cast the spell
 * ([Conditions.CardsInGraveyardMatchingAtLeast] with [GameObjectFilter.Permanent] — descend 8 is
 * an ability word, CR 207.2c, with no rules entry of its own), otherwise it stays 1. Evaluated
 * against the game state at cast time by
 * [com.wingedsheep.engine.handlers.actions.spell.CastSpellHandler].
 *
 * Mode 3 ("look at the top three ... put one into your hand and the rest into your graveyard") is
 * the standard dig recipe [Patterns.Library.lookAtTopAndKeep].
