/**
 * Calamitous Cave-In — {3}{R}
 * Sorcery (LCI #139, uncommon)
 *
 * "Calamitous Cave-In deals X damage to each creature and each planeswalker,
 *  where X is the number of Caves you control plus the number of Cave cards
 *  in your graveyard."
 *
 * X is evaluated at resolution as the sum of:
 *   - Battlefield: permanents with the Cave land subtype you control
 *     ([DynamicAmount.Count] over [Zone.BATTLEFIELD] filtered by [GameObjectFilter.Land.withSubtype("Cave")])
 *   - Graveyard:   any card with the Cave subtype in your graveyard
 *     ([DynamicAmount.Count] over [Zone.GRAVEYARD] filtered by `GameObjectFilter.Any.withSubtype("Cave")`)
 *
 * The two counts are summed via [DynamicAmount.Add] and fed into
 * [Patterns.Group.dealDamageToAll] over [GroupFilter]([GameObjectFilter.CreatureOrPlaneswalker]).
