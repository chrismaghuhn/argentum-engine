/**
 * Tarrian's Soulcleaver (LCI #264) — {1} Legendary Artifact — Equipment (rare)
 *
 * Equipped creature has vigilance.
 * Whenever another artifact or creature is put into a graveyard from the battlefield,
 * put a +1/+1 counter on equipped creature.
 * Equip {2}
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 * - Vigilance is a static [GrantKeyword] scoped to [Filters.EquippedCreature] (standard
 *   equipment keyword grant, à la Sword of Vengeance).
 * - The death payoff is a `Triggers.<subject>.leaves(to, excludeTo, excludeSacrifice)` trigger with `to = Zone.GRAVEYARD`
 *   over the union filter `Artifact or Creature` (any controller — no controller predicate),
 *   bound [TriggerBinding.OTHER] so the Soulcleaver itself (an artifact) never counts
 *   ("another"). The counter lands on [EffectTarget.EquippedCreature]; if the Equipment is
 *   unattached the trigger still fires but resolves as a no-op (no creature to grow).
 * - [equipAbility] wires the Equip {2} sorcery-speed attach.
