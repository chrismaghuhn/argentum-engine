/**
 * Pit of Offerings
 * Land — Cave
 *
 * This land enters tapped.
 * When this land enters, exile up to three target cards from graveyards.
 * {T}: Add {C}.
 * {T}: Add one mana of any of the exiled cards' colors.
 *
 * The exiled cards are linked to this land via `MoveToZoneEffect(linkToSource = true)`, so the
 * fourth ability's color pool ([Effects.AddManaOfColorAmongLinkedExile] →
 * `ManaColorSet.AmongLinkedExiledCards`) is the union of the base colors of the cards still exiled
 * with this land. Colorless-only or empty piles produce no mana (per the printed rulings). Because
 * the link lives on the source permanent, a new Pit of Offerings (or this land leaving and
 * returning) is a fresh object with no remembered cards.
