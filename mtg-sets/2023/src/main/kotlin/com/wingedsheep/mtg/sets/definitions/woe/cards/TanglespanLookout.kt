 * Creature — Satyr
 * 2/3
 *
 * Whenever an Aura you control enters, draw a card.
 *
 * The trigger fires once per Aura, so it uses the generic `entersBattlefield` factory with an
 * `ANY` binding rather than one of the SELF-bound constants. WOE's Role tokens are
 * "Enchantment — Aura Role" tokens, so they match this filter too — that's the card's main
 * payoff in limited.
