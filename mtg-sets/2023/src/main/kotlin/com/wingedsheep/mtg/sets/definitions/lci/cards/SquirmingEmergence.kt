/**
 * Squirming Emergence — {1}{B}{G}
 * Sorcery
 * Rare — The Lost Caverns of Ixalan #241
 * Artist: Simon Dominic
 *
 * "Fathomless descent — Return to the battlefield target nonland permanent card in your
 *  graveyard with mana value less than or equal to the number of permanent cards in your
 *  graveyard."
 *
 * The target is a nonland permanent card in your own graveyard whose mana value is capped by a
 * DYNAMIC amount: the number of permanent cards in your graveyard. Modeled as a graveyard
 * [TargetObject] filtered by [CardPredicate.IsNonland] + [CardPredicate.IsPermanent] +
 * [CardPredicate.ManaValueAtMostDynamic] over
 * [DynamicAmount.Count]`(You, GRAVEYARD, Permanent)` — the same "fathomless descent" count Song of
 * Stupefaction reads. The count includes the targeted card itself while it is still in the
 * graveyard (the cap is evaluated at target-selection time, so a lone permanent card with MV ≤ 1
 * is a legal target). The chosen card is returned via [Effects.PutOntoBattlefield] (untapped),
 * the graveyard-to-battlefield reanimation primitive shared with Helping Hand.
