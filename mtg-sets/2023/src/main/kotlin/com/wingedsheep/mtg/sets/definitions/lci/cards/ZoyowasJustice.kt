/**
 * Zoyowa's Justice
 * {1}{R}
 * Instant
 *
 * The owner of target artifact or creature with mana value 1 or greater shuffles it into their
 * library. Then that player discovers X, where X is its mana value.
 *
 * The discover (and the shuffle) are performed by the *owner* of the target, who need not be the
 * spell's controller, so the whole action is wrapped in [Effects.ForEachPlayer] keyed to
 * [Player.OwnerOf] the target — the loop rebinds the resolution context's controller to the owner,
 * so the discover walks the owner's library and the cast/hand decision is presented to the owner.
 * X is read as the target's mana value ([EffectTarget.ContextTarget] → [EntityNumericProperty.ManaValue]),
 * an intrinsic characteristic that survives the shuffle (the entity keeps its id and CardComponent
 * across the zone change).
