/**
 * Itzquinth, Firstborn of Gishath
 * {R}{G}
 * Legendary Creature — Dinosaur
 * 2/3
 * Haste
 * When Itzquinth enters, you may pay {2}. When you do, target Dinosaur you control deals
 * damage equal to its power to another target creature.
 *
 * The "When you do" phrasing is a reflexive trigger (CR 603.12), modeled as a gated effect
 * ([Effects.MayPay]) where paying {2} unlocks the bite. The ETB trigger resolves to the
 * "Pay {2}?" decision first; only after payment does the reflexive trigger go on the stack
 * and prompt for its two targets:
 *   - t1 (index 0): target Dinosaur you control — any Creature with subtype Dinosaur you
 *     control (including Itzquinth itself, which IS a Dinosaur).
 *   - t2 (index 1): another target creature — [TargetOther] ensures this differs from t1.
 * Damage amount = t1's power at resolution ([DynamicAmounts.targetPower(0)]), and the source
 * of the damage is t1 ([damageSource = t1]), so effects that care about the dealer reference
 * the Dinosaur, not Itzquinth.
