/**
 * Ingenious Prodigy
 * {X}{U}
 * Creature — Human Wizard
 * 0/1
 *
 * Skulk
 * This creature enters with X +1/+1 counters on it.
 * At the beginning of your upkeep, if this creature has one or more +1/+1 counters on it, you may
 * remove a +1/+1 counter from it. If you do, draw a card.
 *
 * Skulk is expressed by its rules text rather than a keyword badge: projected blocker power is
 * compared with the Prodigy's projected power. The upkeep clause is an intervening-if condition,
 * checked both when it would trigger and again on resolution. The optional effect keeps removing
 * the counter and drawing the card in one yes/no branch.
