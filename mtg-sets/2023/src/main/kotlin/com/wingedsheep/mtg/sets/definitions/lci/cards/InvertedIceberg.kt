/**
 * Inverted Iceberg // Iceberg Titan (CR 702.167, The Lost Caverns of Ixalan #60)
 * {1}{U}
 * Artifact // Artifact Creature — Golem
 *
 * Front face — Inverted Iceberg ({1}{U}, Artifact)
 *   When this artifact enters, mill a card, then draw a card.
 *   Craft with artifact {4}{U}{U} ({4}{U}{U}, Exile this artifact, Exile another
 *   artifact you control or an artifact card from your graveyard: Return this card
 *   transformed under its owner's control. Craft only as a sorcery.)
 *
 * Back face — Iceberg Titan (Artifact Creature — Golem, 6/6)
 *   Whenever this creature attacks, you may tap or untap target artifact or creature.
 *
 * Implementation:
 *  - Front ETB: [Effects.Composite] sequencing `Patterns.Library.mill(1)` then
 *    `Effects.DrawCards(1)` — mill fully resolves before the draw, matching the
 *    "mill a card, then draw a card" ordering.
 *  - Craft: the `craft(...)` helper wires [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.AbilityCost.Craft]
 *    (exactly one artifact material: `minCount = 1, maxCount = 1`) plus the {4}{U}{U} mana
 *    cost at sorcery speed; resolution returns the source from exile transformed via
 *    [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.effects.ReturnSelfFromExileTransformedEffect].
 *  - Back attack trigger: declared target ([Targets.CreatureOrArtifact], chosen when the
 *    trigger goes on the stack) with a [Effects.May]-wrapped two-mode [ModalEffect]
 *    (tap / untap via [TapUntapEffect]) decided at resolution — the same idiom as
 *    Sewer-veillance Cam / Gandalf the Grey's "you may tap or untap target ..." clause.
