/**
 * Bloodthorn Flail (LCI #93) — {B} Artifact — Equipment (uncommon)
 *
 * Equipped creature gets +2/+1.
 * Equip—Pay {3} or discard a card.
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 * - The +2/+1 buff is a [ModifyStats] static scoped to [Filters.EquippedCreature].
 * - "Equip—Pay {3} or discard a card" is a single equip ability whose cost is a *choice*
 *   between {3} and discarding a card. The engine has no choice/"or" cost for activated
 *   abilities, so this is modeled as the faithful decomposition into two equip-flagged,
 *   sorcery-speed attach abilities — one costing {3} (via the [equipAbility] facade), one
 *   costing a discarded card. The player picks whichever equip option they can/want to pay,
 *   which is exactly the choice the printed single ability offers (only the presentation
 *   differs: two equip buttons instead of one with a cost prompt).
