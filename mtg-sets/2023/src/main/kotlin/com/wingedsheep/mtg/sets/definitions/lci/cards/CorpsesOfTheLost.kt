/**
 * Corpses of the Lost — {2}{B}
 * Enchantment
 * Rare — LCI #98
 *
 * Skeletons you control get +1/+0 and have haste.
 * When this enchantment enters, create a 2/2 black Skeleton Pirate creature token.
 * At the beginning of your end step, if you descended this turn, you may pay 1 life.
 * If you do, return this enchantment to its owner's hand.
 * (You descended if a permanent card was put into your graveyard from anywhere.)
 *
 * The two static abilities are separate layer-6 continuous effects scoped to
 * [Subtype.SKELETON] creatures the controller controls:
 *  1. [ModifyStats] adds +1/+0 (power bonus, layer 7c).
 *  2. [GrantKeyword] grants haste (layer 6).
 *
 * The end-step trigger is a "descend" trigger (CR 700.11) with an intervening-if gate
 * ([Conditions.YouDescendedThisTurn]). On resolution the player is offered an optional
 * life payment ([Gate.MayPay] via [OptionalCostEffect]); if paid, [Effects.ReturnToHand]
 * bounces the source enchantment to its owner's hand.
