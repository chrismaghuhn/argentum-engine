/**
 * Cosmium Confluence
 * {4}{G} — Sorcery (Rare) — The Lost Caverns of Ixalan #181
 * Artist: Kasia 'Kafis' Zielińska
 *
 * Choose three. You may choose the same mode more than once.
 * • Search your library for a Cave card, put it onto the battlefield tapped, then shuffle.
 * • Put three +1/+1 counters on a Cave you control. It becomes a 0/0 Elemental creature
 *   with haste. It's still a land.
 * • Destroy target enchantment.
 *
 * Modeled via [modal] with chooseCount = 3 and allowRepeat = true.
 * Mode 0 — library tutoring via the Gather → Select → Move pipeline.
 * Mode 1 — counter addition (AddCountersEffect) followed by permanent Cave animation
 *   (BecomeCreatureEffect, Duration.Permanent). No "until end of turn" appears on the card;
 *   the Cave stays a creature unless it leaves the battlefield. The +1/+1 counters keep the
 *   effectively 0/0 body alive (0+3 = 3/3 while counters remain).
 * Mode 2 — targeted enchantment destruction.
