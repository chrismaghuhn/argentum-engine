/**
 * Tendril of the Mycotyrant
 * {1}{G} — Creature — Fungus Wizard (Uncommon) — The Lost Caverns of Ixalan #215
 * Artist: Maxime Minard
 * 2/2
 *
 * {5}{G}{G}: Put seven +1/+1 counters on target noncreature land you control. It becomes
 * a 0/0 Fungus creature with haste. It's still a land.
 *
 * Modeled as an activated ability targeting a noncreature land you control:
 *   AddCountersEffect (seven +1/+1 counters) then BecomeCreatureEffect with base 0/0,
 *   Fungus, haste, Duration.Permanent. No "until end of turn" appears on the card — the
 *   land stays a creature unless it leaves the battlefield. The +1/+1 counters keep the
 *   effectively 0/0 body alive (0+7 = 7/7 while counters remain). It's still a land, so
 *   BecomeCreature adds the creature type/P-T without removing land types.
 *
 * Same "become a 0/0 creature with haste + N +1/+1 counters" animate shape as Cosmium
 * Confluence's Cave mode (LCI #181), reusing AddCounters + permanent BecomeCreature.
