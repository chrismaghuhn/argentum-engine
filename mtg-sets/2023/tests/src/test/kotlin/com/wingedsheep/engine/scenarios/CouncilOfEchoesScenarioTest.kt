/**
 * Council of Echoes (LCI #51): {4}{U}{U} 4/4 Creature — Spirit Advisor
 * "Flying
 *  Descend 4 — When this creature enters, if there are four or more permanent cards in your
 *  graveyard, return up to one target nonland permanent other than this creature to its owner's
 *  hand."
 *
 * Tests:
 *  - With four or more permanent cards in the graveyard: ETB trigger fires, the controller
 *    selects a nonland permanent on the battlefield to bounce (not the Council itself), and
 *    it returns to its owner's hand.
 *  - With fewer than four permanent cards in the graveyard: the intervening-if condition
 *    (Descend 4) is not met; the trigger does not fire and no ChooseTargetsDecision is issued.
 *  - "Up to one" is optional: when the condition is met the controller may decline to choose
 *    any target; the trigger resolves as a no-op and the battlefield is unchanged.
