/**
 * Scenario tests for Another Chance (LCI #90) — {2}{B} Instant.
 *
 * "You may mill two cards. Then return up to two creature cards from your graveyard to your hand."
 *
 * Cases covered:
 *  1. Mill accepted → two cards go from library to graveyard, then two creature cards are
 *     returned from graveyard to hand.
 *  2. Mill declined → library is untouched, but the graveyard-return step still runs and
 *     a creature card is returned to hand.
 *  3. "Up to" is truly optional → selecting zero cards from the graveyard is legal (skip).
 *  4. No creatures in graveyard → selection prompt is auto-skipped (empty collection).
