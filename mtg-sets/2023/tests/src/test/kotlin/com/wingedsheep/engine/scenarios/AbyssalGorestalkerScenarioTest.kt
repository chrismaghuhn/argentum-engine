/**
 * Abyssal Gorestalker (LCI #87) — {4}{B}{B} Creature — Horror 6/6.
 *
 * "When this creature enters, each player sacrifices two creatures of their choice."
 *
 * Proves two cases:
 *  1. When both players control more than two creatures each player is prompted and
 *     independently chooses two to sacrifice (symmetric edict).
 *  2. When a player controls fewer than two creatures the engine auto-sacrifices as
 *     many as possible — no selection prompt is raised.
