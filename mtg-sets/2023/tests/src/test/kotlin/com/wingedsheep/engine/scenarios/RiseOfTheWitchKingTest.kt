/**
 * Rise of the Witch-king (LTR).
 *
 * Symmetric "each player sacrifices a creature of their choice" — both `ForceSacrifice`
 * legs capture a `EntitySnapshot` and inject it into the underlying `EffectContinuation`
 * (the snapshot-threading hook), so the `YouSacrificedThisWay` rider can gate on whether
 * the cast's controller actually sacrificed. The rider's reanimation is *not* a target —
 * the oracle has no "target" word — so the player picks a permanent card from their
 * graveyard at resolution via a `SelectFromCollectionEffect`.
