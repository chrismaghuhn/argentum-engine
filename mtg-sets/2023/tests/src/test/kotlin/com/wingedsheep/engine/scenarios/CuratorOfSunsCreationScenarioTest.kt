/**
 * Scenario coverage for Curator of Sun's Creation — "Whenever you discover, discover again for the
 * same value. This ability triggers only once each turn." — which exercises the new
 * `WheneverYouDiscover` trigger (CR 701.57 / 701.57b) and the `TRIGGER_DISCOVER_VALUE` payload.
 *
 * Each test pins one clause:
 *  - the trigger fires after a discover completes and re-discovers (the DiscoveredEvent lands from a
 *    completed resolution, not the paused may-cast batch);
 *  - the re-discover uses the *same value* N (not 0/default) — discriminated by a card above the
 *    threshold that the second discover must skip;
 *  - `oncePerTurn` caps the otherwise-infinite self-chain at exactly two discovers.
