 *
 * "At the beginning of combat on your turn, this creature explores. Then you may have it
 *  become a copy of another creature you control until end of turn."
 *
 * Tests:
 *  1. Explore with a land on top → land goes to hand; player accepts the copy step →
 *     Deepfathom Echo becomes a copy of the chosen other creature until end of turn
 *     (copiable values only — power/toughness change, counters/attachments are unaffected).
 *  2. Player declines the copy step → Deepfathom Echo stays a 4/4 Merfolk Spirit;
 *     the land still went to hand from explore.
