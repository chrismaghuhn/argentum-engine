/**
 * Samwise the Stouthearted (LTR) — ETB target "permanent card in your graveyard that was put
 * there from the battlefield this turn" (Gap 20). Returns the chosen card to hand, then the
 * Ring tempts you.
 *
 * The "Then the Ring tempts you" rider must fire on every resolution — including when no
 * target was chosen (because the player declined the "up to one" choice or no valid target
 * existed). "Then" sequences effects within the same ability; it isn't conditional on the
 * return succeeding.
