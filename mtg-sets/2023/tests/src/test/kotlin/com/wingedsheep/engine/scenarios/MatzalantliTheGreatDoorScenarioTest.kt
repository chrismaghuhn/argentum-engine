/**
 * Matzalantli, the Great Door // The Core (LCI #256).
 *
 * The novel building block is the transform gate:
 * `Conditions.DistinctPermanentTypesInGraveyard(4)` — "four or more permanent types among cards in
 * your graveyard" (CR 110.4). Proven by activating the transform with a graveyard holding 3 permanent
 * types (+ non-permanent cards that must NOT count) → rejected, then 4 permanent types → allowed; and
 * that a kindred permanent contributes only its permanent type, not "kindred" (CR 300.2b), so a
 * kindred enchantment among 3 permanent types does not spuriously reach four. Also covers The Core's
 * fathomless-descent mana (X = permanent cards in the graveyard).
