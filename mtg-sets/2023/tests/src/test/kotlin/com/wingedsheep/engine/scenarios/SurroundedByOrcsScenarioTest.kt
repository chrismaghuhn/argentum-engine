/**
 * Scenario test for Surrounded by Orcs (LTR #73) — {3}{U} Sorcery.
 *
 * "Amass Orcs 3, then target player mills X cards, where X is the amassed Army's power."
 *
 * "then" (vs. Foray of Orcs' "When you do") means amass and mill resolve as a single
 * sequenced effect on a cast-time target. The mill amount reads the freshly-amassed
 * Army's projected power, exercising `EffectTarget.AmassedArmy` through a
 * `CompositeEffect` of `[Amass, Mill]`.
