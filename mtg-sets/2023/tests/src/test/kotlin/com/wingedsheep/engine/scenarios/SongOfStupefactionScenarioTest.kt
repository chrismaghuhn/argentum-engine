/**
 * Scenario tests for Song of Stupefaction (LCI #77) — {1}{U} Enchantment — Aura.
 *
 *   Enchant creature or Vehicle
 *   When this Aura enters, you may mill two cards.
 *   Fathomless descent — Enchanted permanent gets -X/-0, where X is the number of
 *   permanent cards in your graveyard.
 *
 * The static power penalty is a continuously recomputed [GrantDynamicStats] on the
 * attached permanent: power is reduced by the count of permanent cards in the Aura
 * controller's graveyard (negated via `Multiply(..., -1)`), toughness untouched. Because the
 * Aura can enchant a (non-creature) Vehicle, the penalty must land on any attached permanent,
 * not just creatures.
 *
 * The self-mill ETB is `Patterns.Library.mill(2)` with `optional = true` (same shape as
 * Mineshaft Spider / Deathcap Marionette). The mill tests below are the regression net for the
 * TriggerProcessor bug where a no-target optional trigger with no `elseEffect` dropped the
 * `optional` flag and resolved as mandatory — the player must get a yes/no and a "no" must
 * skip the mill.
