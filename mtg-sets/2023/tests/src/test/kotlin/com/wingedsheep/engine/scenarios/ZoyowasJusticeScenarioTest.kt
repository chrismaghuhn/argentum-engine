/**
 * Zoyowa's Justice ({1}{R} instant): "The owner of target artifact or creature with mana value 1
 * or greater shuffles it into their library. Then that player discovers X, where X is its mana
 * value."
 *
 * The card composes three existing primitives — no engine change was needed:
 *  - a `CreatureOrArtifact.manaValueAtLeast(1)` target;
 *  - `Effects.ForEachPlayer(Player.OwnerOf(...))` to rebind the resolution controller to the
 *    target's *owner* (who need not be the spell's controller), so the shuffle and the discover
 *    are performed by, and the cast/hand decision is presented to, that owner;
 *  - `Effects.Discover` with the threshold read as the target's mana value
 *    (`EntityProperty(ContextTarget(0), ManaValue)`), which survives the shuffle because the entity keeps
 *    its id and CardComponent across the zone change.
