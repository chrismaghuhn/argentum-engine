/**
 * Coati Scavenger (LCI #179): {2}{G} 3/2 Creature — Raccoon
 * "Descend 4 — When this creature enters, if there are four or more permanent cards in your
 * graveyard, return target permanent card from your graveyard to your hand."
 *
 * Tests:
 *  - With four or more permanent cards in the graveyard: ETB trigger fires, the controller
 *    selects a target permanent card from their graveyard, and it returns to their hand.
 *  - With fewer than four permanent cards in the graveyard: the intervening-if condition
 *    (Descend 4) is not met, the trigger does not fire, and graveyard remains unchanged.
