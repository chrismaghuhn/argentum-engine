/**
 * Razia's Purification (RAV #224) — "Each player chooses three permanents they control, then
 * sacrifices the rest."
 *
 * Two things are worth proving about the `ChooseExactly(3)` keep. First that it is symmetric: the
 * caster is a "player" too, so an implementation that quietly scoped the gather to opponents
 * (or to the controller) leaves one board untouched. Second, the 2005-10-01 ruling — "if a player
 * doesn't control three permanents, that player chooses all the permanents they do control and
 * doesn't sacrifice anything" — which is exactly `ChooseExactly`'s clamp to the collection size,
 * and would instead read as a *deadlock or a lost board* under a strict-N selection.
