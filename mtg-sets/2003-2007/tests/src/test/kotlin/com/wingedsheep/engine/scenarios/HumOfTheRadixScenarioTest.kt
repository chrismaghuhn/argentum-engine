/**
 * Hum of the Radix (MRD #122) — "Each artifact spell costs {1} more to cast for each artifact its
 * controller controls."
 *
 * Two things separate this from every tax already in the corpus, and a wrong implementation passes
 * a naive test on both. The tax is *dynamic*, so it has to be recomputed off the board rather than
 * read off the card; and it is charged against **the caster's** artifacts, not the enchantment
 * controller's — a distinction that is invisible whenever one player happens to control all the
 * artifacts, which is exactly the board a single-player test builds. So the load-bearing case here
 * is the asymmetric one: the same artifact spell priced for both players at once, each paying for
 * their own board.
 *
 * The remaining cases pin the edges the tax could silently overreach into: no artifacts is no tax
 * (not a floor of one), and a nonartifact spell is untouched however many artifacts are out.
