/**
 * Rings of Brighthearth (LRW #259) — "Whenever you activate an ability, if it isn't a mana ability,
 * you may pay {2}. If you do, copy that ability. You may choose new targets for the copy."
 *
 * Three axes, and each is a place the card would read right and resolve wrong:
 *
 *  - **The copy has to find the ability that fired it.** `EffectTarget.TriggeringEntity` on an
 *    `AbilityActivatedEvent` is the activated ability still on the stack beneath this trigger; if it
 *    resolved to nothing, the whole card would be a silent no-op that the snapshot golden cannot
 *    see. The happy path asserts *two* pings landed, not just that a decision was offered.
 *  - **The {2} is optional.** Declining must leave the original ability untouched — one ping, not
 *    zero and not two.
 *  - **A mana ability must not trigger it at all.** This is the clause that is easiest to wire
 *    twice or not at all; Llanowar Elves' "{T}: Add {G}" is the cheapest proof, and the assertion is
 *    that no decision is ever raised.
 *
 * The copy's "you may choose new targets" prompt is a `ChooseTargetsDecision` raised by the shared
 * copy executor (CR 707.10c), so the happy path re-submits the same target rather than skipping it.
