/**
 * Ashling the Pilgrim (LRW #149) — "{1}{R}: Put a +1/+1 counter on Ashling. If this is the third
 * time this ability has resolved this turn, remove all +1/+1 counters from Ashling, and it deals
 * that much damage to each creature and each player."
 *
 * Two claims that a card built from existing primitives can still get wrong, and neither is
 * visible in the snapshot golden:
 *
 *  - **"That much" is the count *before* the removal.** The damage reads a
 *    `StoreNumber` captured ahead of `RemoveAllCountersOfType`; wiring it to read the counters
 *    directly would evaluate after the removal and deal 0 to everything. Three damage vs. zero is
 *    the whole assertion.
 *  - **The stored number has to survive the per-player loop.** `ForEachPlayerEffect` resets stored
 *    *collections* per iteration; if it reset stored *numbers* too, creatures would take 3 and
 *    players 0. Asserting both halves of "each creature and each player" is what separates them.
 *
 * The first test also pins the equality on the *second* resolution: a `>= 3` mis-wiring reads
 * identically on the card and only shows up there.
