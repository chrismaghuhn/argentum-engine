/**
 * Mesmeric Orb (MRD) — "Whenever a permanent becomes untapped, that permanent's controller mills a
 * card."
 *
 * A regression test for a bug this card shipped with. The definition always read
 * `Patterns.Library.mill(1, EffectTarget.ControllerOfTriggeringEntity)` — the right thing — but
 * `mill` mapped every target it did not explicitly recognise to `Player.You`, and
 * `ControllerOfTriggeringEntity` was not among the four it recognised. So the Orb's *own*
 * controller milled on every untap, whoever the permanent belonged to. Nothing caught it: the
 * golden snapshot serialises the intended `EffectTarget`, the card still milled exactly one card
 * per untap, and there was no scenario test.
 *
 * "That permanent's controller" is the entire card, so the assertions are about which library
 * shrinks — and always about both, since milling the wrong player is invisible if you only check
 * that a mill happened.
