/**
 * Wizened Snitches (RAV #75) — "Players play with the top card of their libraries revealed."
 *
 * The symmetric sibling of Goblin Spy's self-scoped reveal, and the asymmetry is exactly what
 * these tests pin: one Snitches opens *both* libraries to *both* players, including the library of
 * the player who controls nothing. Goblin Spy is played alongside as the control — its reveal
 * still opens only its own controller's library, so a regression that made every reveal symmetric
 * would be caught here rather than in Goblin Spy's own test.
