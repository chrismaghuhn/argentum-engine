/**
 * Stoneshaker Shaman (RAV #145) — {2}{R} 1/1 Creature — Human Shaman
 *
 * "At the beginning of each player's end step, that player sacrifices an untapped land of their
 *  choice."
 *
 * Two things are easy to get wrong here and both are tested. The trigger is
 * `Triggers.anyPlayer.beginningOf(Step.END)`, not `YourEndStep`, so it fires on the Shaman's
 * controller's own turn too — this card is symmetric. And the sacrificing player is
 * `Player.TriggeringPlayer` (whoever's end step it is), not the Shaman's controller, which the
 * second test pins by putting the Shaman under the *non-active* player's control.
 *
 * The `untapped()` predicate is the third axis: per the RAV ruling, a player with no *untapped*
 * land sacrifices nothing rather than being forced to give up a tapped one.
