/**
 * Sword of Kaldra (MRD #251) — "Equipped creature gets +5/+5. Whenever equipped creature deals damage
 * to a creature, exile that creature." Equip {4}.
 *
 * Two claims in the trigger are easy to get backwards, and both are pinned here.
 *
 * **"That creature" is the *damaged* one.** A damage trigger stamps the *recipient* as the triggering
 * entity, so `EffectTarget.TriggeringEntity` is the creature that was hit — not the equipped creature
 * that hit it. The exile landing on the wrong side of the damage would still "work" in a test that
 * only counted exiles.
 *
 * **"Deals damage", not "deals combat damage".** A Viridian Longbow ping is the cleanest proof: it is
 * noncombat damage, and it is only 1, so the target survives the damage itself and can be observed
 * going to exile rather than dying to a state-based action. (The printed reminder "(Exile it only if
 * it's still on the battlefield)" is why a lethal hit needs no wiring — there is nothing left to move.)
