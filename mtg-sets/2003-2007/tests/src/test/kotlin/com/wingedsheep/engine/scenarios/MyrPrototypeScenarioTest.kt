/**
 * Myr Prototype (MRD #214) — "At the beginning of your upkeep, put a +1/+1 counter on this
 * creature. This creature can't attack or block unless you pay {1} for each +1/+1 counter on it."
 *
 * The card is a self-taxer, which is a different animal from Ghostly Prison: the permanent charging
 * the tax and the creature paying it are the same object, so the amount has to be read off the
 * *declared* creature rather than off the board. Two mistakes are available and both look fine on a
 * one-creature board — reading the counters of some other permanent, and charging every declared
 * creature the Prototype's price. The counter-holding bystander and the untaxed co-attacker below
 * are there to fail on exactly those.
 *
 * The zero-counter case matters too: a Prototype that just resolved owes nothing, so the tax must
 * be a plain 0 rather than a floor of {1} that quietly stops a fresh Myr from attacking.
 *
 * Amounts are asserted through [CombatTaxes] directly, since that is the shared pricing entry point
 * the AI reads as well; one declaration test then proves the price is actually charged.
