/**
 * Goblin Charbelcher (MRD #176) — "{3}, {T}: Reveal cards from the top of your library until you
 * reveal a land card. This artifact deals damage equal to the number of nonland cards revealed this
 * way to any target. If the revealed land card was a Mountain, this artifact deals double that
 * damage instead. Put the revealed cards on the bottom of your library in any order."
 *
 * Three things can quietly go wrong here and only one of them is the Mountain clause. The damage
 * counts the *nonlands*, not the reveal — those differ by exactly one whenever a stopper was found,
 * so a card that fed the whole pile into the damage amount would look right on a Mountain-less
 * board and be off by one everywhere. The doubling has to replace the amount rather than add a
 * second damage event ("double that damage instead"). And running the library out is the no-stopper
 * path: the Mountain condition must read false off an *empty* match collection rather than throw,
 * which is the 2016-06-08 ruling.
 *
 * Each test drives a hand-built library so the reveal window is exact, and checks the bottoming as
 * well — the library must come back the same size with the revealed cards moved underneath.
