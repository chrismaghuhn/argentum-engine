/**
 * Mirror Entity (LRW #31) — "{X}: Until end of turn, creatures you control have base power and
 * toughness X/X and gain all creature types."
 *
 * Three things are being proved, none of which is visible in the card's own text:
 *
 *  - **X reaches the group body.** The X paid for the activation has to survive into a
 *    `ForEachInGroup` iteration. If it were lost, every creature would be set to 0/0 and the
 *    board would evaporate — a failure that looks exactly like a legitimate X=0 activation, so
 *    the X=0 case is asserted separately to keep the two distinguishable.
 *  - **It sets a *base*, not a bonus.** A 3/3 taken to X=1 must *shrink*, which is what
 *    separates layer 7b from a `ModifyStats` that would read the same on the card.
 *  - **The changeling half is not decoration.** "Gain all creature types" is the reason this
 *    card is a tribal payoff at all; a script that only set P/T would pass every stat assertion.
 *
 * The X=0 board wipe is the printed behaviour, not a bug: "Activating the ability with X = 0
 * will cause all creatures you control to become 0/0 and be put into the graveyard."
 * (2021-03-19)
