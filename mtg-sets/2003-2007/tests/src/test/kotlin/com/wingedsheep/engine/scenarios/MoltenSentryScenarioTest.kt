/**
 * Molten Sentry (RAV) — "As this creature enters, flip a coin. If the coin comes up heads, this
 * creature enters as a 5/2 creature with haste. If it comes up tails, this creature enters as a
 * 2/5 creature with defender."
 *
 * The card is printed `*`/`*`, so the *only* thing that gives the Sentry a size is the entry
 * replacement. Every assertion therefore reads the **projected** stats and keywords and pairs them
 * with the coin flip that actually happened, rather than seeding a particular outcome: a seed→face
 * mapping is an implementation detail of the RNG, while "whatever the coin said, the body matches
 * it" is the card.
 *
 * The last test runs the entry many times over and insists on seeing both faces — that is what
 * catches a branch that silently never fires (an `OnEnterRun` dropped on some entry path, or
 * a `lostEffect` that never runs), which a single-outcome test cannot.
