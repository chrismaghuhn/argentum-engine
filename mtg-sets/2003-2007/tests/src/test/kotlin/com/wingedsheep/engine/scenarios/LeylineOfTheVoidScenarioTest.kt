/**
 * Scenario tests for Leyline of the Void (Guildpact #52):
 *   "If this card is in your opening hand, you may begin the game with it on the battlefield.
 *    If a card would be put into an opponent's graveyard from anywhere, exile it instead."
 *
 * The replacement is [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.RedirectZoneChange] graveyard -> exile scoped
 * to `ownedByOpponent()`. These tests prove the asymmetry that defines the card: a card that would
 * head to an *opponent's* graveyard is exiled instead, while a card going to the *controller's own*
 * graveyard is untouched.
