/**
 * Remand (RAV #63) — "Counter target spell. If that spell is countered this way, put it into its
 * owner's hand instead of into that player's graveyard. Draw a card."
 *
 * This pins the new `CounterDestination.Hand` where it differs from a bounce. Remand is a genuine
 * counter, so an **uncounterable** spell is neither countered nor returned — it resolves — while
 * the draw still happens (2021-03-19 ruling). `ReturnSpellToOwnersHandEffect` would have "countered"
 * it, which is exactly the mis-modelling this destination exists to avoid.
 *
 * The caster is the *non*-active player: a creature spell is sorcery-speed, so only the active
 * player can put one on the stack, and the responder is the one holding the instant.
