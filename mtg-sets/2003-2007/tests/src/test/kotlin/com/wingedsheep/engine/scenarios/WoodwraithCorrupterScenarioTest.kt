/**
 * Woodwraith Corrupter (RAV #240) — "{1}{B}{G}, {T}: Target Forest becomes a 4/4 black and green
 * Elemental Horror creature. It's still a land."
 *
 * The claim worth pinning is the one the card's own ruling makes: the animation has **no stated
 * duration**, so it survives the cleanup step. A `Duration.EndOfTurn` slip reads identically on the
 * turn it is used and is invisible to the snapshot net, so the "still a 4/4 next turn" assertion is
 * the whole point of this file. Beside it: the Forest keeps LAND and its Forest subtype ("it's
 * still a land", so it still taps for {G}), and its colors are *replaced* with black and green
 * rather than added to — an animated Forest is not green-only.
