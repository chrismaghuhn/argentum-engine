/**
 * Master Warcraft (RAV #250) — "Cast this spell only before attackers are declared. You choose
 * which creatures attack this turn. You choose which creatures block this turn and how those
 * creatures block."
 *
 * The declarations move to the caster and nothing else does: the legal declare-attackers /
 * declare-blockers action is offered to the caster (and withheld from the seat that owes it), the
 * declaration itself is still that seat's and is validated against its creatures, and the effect
 * lapses with the turn. The timing line allows casting up to the beginning of combat step of the
 * first combat, and not from the declare attackers step on.
