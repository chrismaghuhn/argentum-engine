/**
 * Lammastide Weave (LRW #226) — "Choose a card name, then target player mills a card. If a card
 * with the chosen name was milled this way, you gain life equal to its mana value. Draw a card."
 *
 * The gamble is the whole card, so the test runs it both ways off the *same* board: the same
 * milled card, once with the name guessed right and once with it guessed wrong. That pairing is
 * what separates a working name check from one that fails open (always pays) or fails closed
 * (never pays) — either mis-wiring is invisible against a single run.
 *
 * "Equal to its mana value" is read off the milled card, not off Lammastide Weave, so the milled
 * card deliberately has a mana value ({3}{G}{G} = 5) that no other number on the board could be
 * confused for.
 *
 * The draw is a separate sentence and happens either way, which is the third assertion in both
 * directions. It is asserted as "the hand is the size it was before casting": one card left for
 * the spell, one came back from the draw.
