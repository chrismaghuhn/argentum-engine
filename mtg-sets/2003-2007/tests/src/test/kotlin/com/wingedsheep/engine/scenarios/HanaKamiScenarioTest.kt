/**
 * Hana Kami (CHK #211) — {G} Creature — Spirit 1/1.
 *
 *   {1}{G}, Sacrifice this creature: Return target Arcane card from your graveyard to your hand.
 *
 * **The first card in the corpus to filter on `Subtype.ARCANE`.** `Subtype.ARCANE` has existed in
 * `mtg-sdk` for a long time, but until this sweep nothing read it, so a filter that silently matched
 * every card in the graveyard — or matched nothing at all — would have looked identical from the
 * outside. Both directions are asserted here: an Arcane card must be a legal target, and a
 * non-Arcane card in the same graveyard must not be.
 *
 * Note also that Argentum Assay *declines* this card's line — its grammar has no rule for the noun
 * phrase "an Arcane card" — so it was authored from the printed text rather than from `assay
 * compile`. That makes this test the only mechanical check on the wiring.
