/**
 * Lairwatch Giant (LRW #29) — "This creature can block an additional creature each combat.
 * Whenever this creature blocks two or more creatures, it gains first strike until end of turn."
 *
 * The card exists to exercise `BlockEvent.minBlockedAttackers`, and the axis has exactly one way to
 * be wrong that still reads right on the card: a bar that is never enforced. `BlockEvent` fires for
 * *any* block, so an unread count gives a Giant that blocks one creature first strike too — which
 * no "it works" test would notice. Hence the pair: two blocks grants it, one block does not.
 *
 * The count is also why the trigger fires **once**. "Blocks two or more creatures" is a single
 * event, and the 2007-10-01 ruling is explicit that a Giant already blocking two doesn't trigger
 * again when pushed to three. Asserting the stack holds exactly one trigger is the cheap proof.
 *
 * The two-creature block itself is the first ability doing its job: without
 * `CanBlockAdditionalForCreatureGroup` the declaration would be rejected outright, so a successful
 * `declareBlockers` over two attackers covers it.
