/**
 * Svogthos, the Restless Tomb
 * Land
 *
 * {T}: Add {C}.
 * {3}{B}{G}: Until end of turn, this land becomes a black and green Plant Zombie creature with
 * "This creature's power and toughness are each equal to the number of creature cards in your
 * graveyard." It's still a land.
 *
 * The granted clause is a **characteristic-defining ability**, not a size frozen at resolution, so
 * the count goes in `dynamicPower`/`dynamicToughness` (re-evaluated at Layer 7b on every
 * projection) rather than in `power`/`toughness`, which serve only as the star-P/T rules-text
 * display. That is what the 2005-10-01 ruling requires: "Svogthos's power and toughness changes
 * each time a creature card enters or leaves its controller's graveyard."
 *
 * Svogthos animates *itself*, so `you` in the CDA is its own controller — the same player the
 * animating ability's controller is — and the two never disagree.
 *
 * "It's still a land" is [Effects.BecomeCreature]'s default: CREATURE and the two subtypes are
 * added without removing LAND, so the animated Svogthos still taps for {C}. Note that it counts
 * *creature cards*, so Svogthos itself in the graveyard (a land card) never adds to the total.
