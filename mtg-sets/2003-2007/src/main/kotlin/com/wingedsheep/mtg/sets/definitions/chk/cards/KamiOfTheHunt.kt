/**
 * Kami of the Hunt
 * {2}{G}
 * Creature — Spirit
 * 2/2
 * Whenever you cast a Spirit or Arcane spell, this creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn.
 *
 * The Kamigawa "Whenever you cast a Spirit or Arcane spell" trigger is a `SpellCastEvent` watching
 * *your* casts with an OR over the two subtypes — `withAnySubtype` builds the single
 * `CardPredicate.Or` the grammar expects, rather than the `anyOf` branch list that the `or` infix
 * on `GameObjectFilter` would produce. `Triggers.you.casts(spell, requires)` supplies `Player.You` and
 * `TriggerBinding.ANY`, so Kami of the Hunt also triggers off its own cast.
 *
 * The pump names `EffectTarget.Self` rather than the triggering entity: the boost belongs to the
 * Kami, not to the spell that set it off.
