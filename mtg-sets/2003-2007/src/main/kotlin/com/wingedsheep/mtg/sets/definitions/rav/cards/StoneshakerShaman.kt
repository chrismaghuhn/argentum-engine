/**
 * Stoneshaker Shaman
 * {2}{R}
 * Creature — Human Shaman
 * 1/1
 *
 * At the beginning of each player's end step, that player sacrifices an untapped land of their
 * choice.
 *
 * "Each player's end step" is `Triggers.anyPlayer.beginningOf(Step.END)` — a `StepEvent(END, Player.Each)`. Only the
 * active player has an end step in a given turn, so this fires once per turn and
 * [Player.TriggeringPlayer] is whoever's turn it is. The Shaman's controller is not spared: the
 * sentence names the player whose step it is, not an opponent, which is what makes this a
 * symmetric card.
 *
 * "Of their choice" is the ordinary [Effects.Sacrifice] semantics — the sacrificing player picks,
 * not the Shaman's controller — and the `untapped()` predicate keeps a player who has tapped out
 * for the turn from choosing a land they've already used. Per the ruling below, a player with no
 * untapped land simply does nothing; `ForceSacrificeEffect` sacrifices as many as it can find
 * rather than failing.
