/**
 * Riftwing Cloudskate
 * {3}{U}{U}
 * Creature — Illusion
 * 2 / 2
 * Flying
 * When this creature enters, return target permanent to its owner's hand.
 * Suspend 3—{1}{U} (Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay {1}{U} and exile it with three time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, you may cast it without paying its mana cost. It has haste.)
 *
 * The bounce is unrestricted — [Targets.Permanent], not a nonland filter — so the trigger can
 * take a land, its own controller's permanent, or anything else on the battlefield.
