/**
 * Lowland Oaf
 * {3}{R}
 * Creature — Giant Warrior
 * 3/3
 * {T}: Target Goblin creature you control gets +1/+0 and gains flying until end of turn. Sacrifice
 * that creature at the beginning of the next end step.
 *
 * The Giant throws a Goblin, and the Goblin does not survive it. The delayed sacrifice is the
 * Skirk Alarmist shape: `CreateDelayedTriggerEffect(step = END)` over
 * `Effects.SacrificeTarget(<the same bound target>)`. `CreateDelayedTriggerExecutor` bakes the
 * chosen target into a concrete entity id when the trigger is *scheduled*, so the sacrifice hits
 * the creature that was launched even though the ability's execution context is long gone.
 *
 * The target is "Goblin **creature** you control" — a noncreature Goblin permanent (a Goblin
 * Kindred artifact, say) is not a legal target, which is why this is `TargetCreature` over a
 * subtype-narrowed filter rather than a bare `Permanent.withSubtype`.
 *
 * If the creature has already left the battlefield when the end step arrives, the delayed trigger
 * simply finds nothing to sacrifice; and activating this during an end step pushes the sacrifice to
 * the *next* one, a turn later.
