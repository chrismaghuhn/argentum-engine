/**
 * Rings of Brighthearth
 * {3}
 * Artifact
 * Whenever you activate an ability, if it isn't a mana ability, you may pay {2}. If you do, copy
 * that ability. You may choose new targets for the copy.
 *
 * The whole card is three existing pieces stacked in the order the sentence reads:
 *
 * - **"if it isn't a mana ability" is part of the trigger, not an intervening "if".** It reads as a
 *   condition because Oracle templating puts it after the comma, but a mana ability never uses the
 *   stack (CR 605.1a) and so can never be the object of a "whenever you activate" trigger in the
 *   first place. `Triggers.you.activatesAbility()` already carries that gate —
 *   `AbilityActivatedEvent(player = Player.You)` excludes mana abilities by default — so wiring the
 *   clause a second time as an `interveningIf` would be redundant, and worse, would re-check it on
 *   resolution where the printed clause never does.
 * - **The {2} is a resolution-time optional cost, not an additional cost of the trigger.**
 *   [Effects.MayPay] (a `Gate.MayPay` over [PayManaCostEffect]) is the "you may pay … If you
 *   do, …" shape, and its one-yes-per-resolution nature is exactly the 2020-11-10 ruling: "You
 *   can't pay {2} more than once for each time the triggered ability of Rings of Brighthearth
 *   resolves."
 * - **The copy is [Effects.CopyTargetSpellOrAbility] over [EffectTarget.TriggeringEntity]** — the
 *   activated ability still sitting on the stack underneath this trigger. That executor already
 *   prompts for new targets per CR 707.10c, so the printed "You may choose new targets for the
 *   copy" needs no separate effect, and it copies the ability's chosen value of X along with its
 *   targets (the third ruling). Pit Automaton is the same pairing, reached through a delayed
 *   trigger instead of a printed one.
 *
 * The "activated an ability" event fires only *after* all costs are paid (CR 602.2), which is why
 * the sixth ruling holds for free: an ability whose cost sacrifices the Rings is activated at a
 * moment when the Rings is already gone, so the static index no longer carries this trigger.
 *
 * "An ability" is unrestricted by source — an ability of a permanent an opponent controls that
 * *you* activate (a granted "any player may activate" ability) still counts, as does a loyalty
 * ability, which is an activated ability.
