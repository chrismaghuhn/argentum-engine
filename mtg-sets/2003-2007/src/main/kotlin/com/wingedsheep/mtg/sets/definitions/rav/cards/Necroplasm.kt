/**
 * Necroplasm
 * {1}{B}{B}
 * Creature — Ooze
 * 1/1
 * At the beginning of your upkeep, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature.
 * At the beginning of your end step, destroy each creature with mana value equal to the number of
 * +1/+1 counters on this creature.
 * Dredge 2
 *
 * A sweeper on a clock: the counter added each upkeep is also the mana value the end step sweeps,
 * so it eats one-drops on the turn it lands, two-drops next turn, and so on up the curve.
 *
 * The destroy filter reads the counter count off the source at resolution
 * (`manaValueEqualsDynamic` over an [EntityNumericProperty.CounterCount] on
 * [EffectTarget.Self]) rather than baking a number in — the whole point of the card is that
 * the number moves. Necroplasm's own mana value is 3, so a third counter includes it in its own
 * sweep; nothing special is needed for that, it simply matches its own filter.
 *
 * Dredge 2 is what makes the escalation reusable: the Ooze that swept itself away comes back for
 * a draw and starts the count over at one.
