/**
 * Kithkin Mourncaller
 * {2}{G}
 * Creature — Kithkin Scout
 * 2/2
 * Whenever an attacking Kithkin or Elf is put into your graveyard from the battlefield, you may
 * draw a card.
 *
 * No "another": Mourncaller is itself a Kithkin, so dying while attacking triggers its own ability
 * ([TriggerBinding.ANY]). "Your graveyard" is ownership rather than control — a permanent always
 * goes to its owner's graveyard (CR 400.3). The attacking check is answered from last-known
 * information: the creature is removed from combat as it leaves the battlefield (CR 506.4), so the
 * trigger gate reads the zone-change snapshot's `wasAttacking`.
