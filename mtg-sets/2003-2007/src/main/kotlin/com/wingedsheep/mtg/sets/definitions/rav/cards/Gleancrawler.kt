/**
 * Gleancrawler — Ravnica: City of Guilds #247
 * {3}{B/G}{B/G}{B/G} · Creature — Insect Horror · 6/6 · Rare
 *
 * Trample
 * At the beginning of your end step, return to your hand all creature cards in your graveyard
 * that were put there from the battlefield this turn.
 *
 * One Gather → Move pipeline over your own graveyard, the Second Sunrise shape narrowed to
 * creature cards. `putIntoGraveyardFromBattlefieldThisTurn()` is the whole clause: it reads the
 * per-card marker `ZoneTransitionService` stamps on every graveyard arrival from the battlefield
 * and wipes at the untap step, so a creature milled this turn or one that died last turn stays
 * put, and one that died before Gleancrawler arrived still comes back (the 2005 ruling).
 *
 * The move sends each card to its owner's hand: the zone transition routes non-battlefield
 * destinations to the card's owner, so a stolen creature that died under your control goes home
 * even though it sat in *your* graveyard — CR 400.3 puts it there, and "return to your hand" for
 * an opponent's card is impossible, so the engine's owner routing is the correct reading.
