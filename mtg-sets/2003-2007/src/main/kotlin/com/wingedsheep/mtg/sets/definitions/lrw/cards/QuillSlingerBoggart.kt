/**
 * Quill-Slinger Boggart
 * {3}{B}
 * Creature — Goblin Warrior
 * 3/2
 * Whenever a player casts a Kithkin spell, you may have target player lose 1 life.
 *
 * "A player" is every player, the Boggart's controller included, so this is
 * `Triggers.anyPlayer.casts(spell, requires)` — the same shape as Bog-Strider Ash and Elvish Handservant. The spell
 * filter is [GameObjectFilter.Any] rather than `.Creature`: a Kithkin spell is any spell with the
 * subtype, and Lorwyn prints Kindred noncreature ones (Militia's Pride is a Kithkin enchantment
 * spell). The "you may" is `optional = true`, which the builder lowers to a Effects.May; the yes/no
 * is asked as the ability goes on the stack, before targets are chosen, so declining never forces
 * a pointless target.
