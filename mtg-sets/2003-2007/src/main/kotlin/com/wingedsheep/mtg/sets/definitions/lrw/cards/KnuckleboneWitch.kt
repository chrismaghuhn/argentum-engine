/**
 * Knucklebone Witch
 * {B}
 * Creature — Goblin Shaman
 * 1/1
 * Whenever a Goblin you control is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, you may put a
 * +1/+1 counter on this creature.
 *
 * The bare tribal noun "Goblin" names every permanent with the subtype, not only the creatures, so
 * the filter is [GameObjectFilter.Permanent]. There is no "another" here — the Witch is itself a
 * Goblin and does trigger on its own death, which is why the binding is [TriggerBinding.ANY]; by
 * the time that copy of the trigger resolves the Witch is gone and the counter has nowhere to go.
 *
 * "A graveyard", not "your graveyard": a Goblin you control but don't own still triggers this on
 * the way to its owner's graveyard, so the filter reads control and the destination is unqualified.
