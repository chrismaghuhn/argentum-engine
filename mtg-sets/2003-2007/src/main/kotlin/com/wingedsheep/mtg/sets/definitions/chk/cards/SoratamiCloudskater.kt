 * Creature — Moonfolk Rogue
 * 1 / 1

 * Flying
 * {2}, Return a land you control to its owner's hand: Draw a card, then discard a card.
 *
 * The Moonfolk land-bounce cost is [Costs.ReturnToHand] over `GameObjectFilter.Land` composed with
 * the mana half; "you control" is carried by the atom's enumerator, not by the filter. The loot is
 * the ordinary draw-then-discard composition — [Effects.DrawCards] followed by
 * [Patterns.Hand.discardCards], whose Gather → Select → Move pipeline is what makes the discard a
 * real choice rather than a random one.
