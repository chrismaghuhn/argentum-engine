/**
 * Faerie Tauntings
 * {2}{B}
 * Kindred Enchantment — Faerie
 * Whenever you cast a spell during an opponent's turn, you may have each opponent lose 1 life.
 *
 * "During an opponent's turn" is every turn that isn't yours — each other player is an opponent —
 * so the trigger restriction is [Conditions.IsOpponentsTurn], the same reading Glen Elendra
 * Pranksters uses. The "may" is one decision for the whole ability, not one per opponent
 * (ruling 2007-10-01), which is exactly what wrapping the single `EachOpponent` life loss in a
 * [Effects.May] gives.
 *
 * Note: "Tribal" was errata'd to "Kindred" in 2024.
