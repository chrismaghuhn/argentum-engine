/**
 * Dolmen Gate
 * {2}
 * Artifact
 *
 * Prevent all combat damage that would be dealt to attacking creatures you control.
 *
 * A static prevention shield in the Fog Bank / Daunting Defender family — a [PreventDamage]
 * replacement effect with no amount (prevent *all* of it) whose recipient is a live filter
 * rather than a fixed entity. The filter is re-read when each damage instance would be dealt,
 * so a creature that stops attacking, or that comes under your control mid-combat, is judged
 * as it is at that moment.
 *
 * [DamageType.Combat] is load-bearing: the shield covers only combat damage, so a burn spell
 * aimed at an attacker of yours still connects. "You control" scopes to the Gate's controller,
 * so it does nothing for an opponent's attackers — it only protects your own alpha strike.
