/**
 * Benthicore
 * {6}{U}
 * Creature — Elemental
 * 5/5
 * When this creature enters, create two 1/1 blue Merfolk Wizard creature tokens.
 * Tap two untapped Merfolk you control: Untap this creature. It gains shroud until end of turn.
 *
 * The two tokens it brings along are exactly the two Merfolk its own ability wants, so it arrives
 * able to pay for itself once.
 *
 * The cost is the Summon the School shape — `Costs.TapPermanents(count = 2, …)`. Both restrictions
 * the oracle text spells out are the engine's, not the filter's: `CostPaymentService` builds the
 * candidate pool with `controlledUntapped`, so "untapped" and "you control" are enforced for
 * affordability, for the prompt, and for validation from one place. Summoning sickness never
 * applies to a permanent tapped to pay a cost (CR 302.6 is about the `{T}` symbol), so a
 * just-arrived Merfolk token can pay.
 *
 * Note the ability has **no `{T}` of its own** — Benthicore itself is never tapped to activate it,
 * which is what lets an already-tapped Benthicore untap by paying, and lets a player untap it
 * repeatedly with enough Merfolk. Benthicore is an Elemental, not a Merfolk, so it can never be
 * part of its own cost regardless.
