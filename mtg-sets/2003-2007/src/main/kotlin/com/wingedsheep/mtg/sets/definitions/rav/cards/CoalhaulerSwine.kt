/**
 * Coalhauler Swine
 * {4}{R}{R}
 * Creature — Boar Beast
 * 4/4
 * Whenever this creature is dealt damage, it deals that much damage to each player.
 *
 * `Triggers.self.isDealtDamage()` is the any-source "is dealt damage" trigger (combat, burn, pingers alike);
 * the amount rides the trigger context as [ContextPropertyKey.TRIGGER_DAMAGE_AMOUNT], the same way
 * Tephraderm reads it. "Each player" includes the Swine's own controller, so the payoff is a single
 * [DealDamageEffect] at [EffectTarget.PlayerRef] over [Player.Each] rather than an opponent loop.
