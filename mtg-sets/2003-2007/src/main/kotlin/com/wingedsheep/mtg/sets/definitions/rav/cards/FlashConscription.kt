/**
 * Flash Conscription
 * {5}{R}
 * Instant
 *
 * Untap target creature and gain control of it until end of turn. That creature gains haste until
 * end of turn. If {W} was spent to cast this spell, the creature gains "Whenever this creature
 * deals combat damage, you gain that much life" until end of turn.
 *
 * One of Ravnica's "if {X} was spent" riders: the card is mono-red and the white mana is a
 * *payment* question, not a colour requirement, so a Boros land or any-colour source turns it on.
 * `Conditions.ManaSpentToCastIncludes` reads the payment recorded on the spell, so a copy of Flash
 * Conscription — never cast, nothing spent for it — correctly misses the rider.
 *
 * The granted ability is the Vigorous Charge shape: a `GrantTriggeredAbilityEffect` carrying a
 * combat-damage trigger whose amount is the event's own damage. The life goes to the ability's
 * controller, i.e. whoever controls the creature when it connects — which is you for this turn,
 * and its owner again once the control effect wears off (2005-10-01 ruling).
