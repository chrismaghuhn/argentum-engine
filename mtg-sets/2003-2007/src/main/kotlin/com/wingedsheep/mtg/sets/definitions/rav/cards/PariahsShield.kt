/**
 * Pariah's Shield — Ravnica: City of Guilds #267
 * {5} · Artifact — Equipment
 *
 * All damage that would be dealt to you is dealt to equipped creature instead.
 * Equip {3}
 *
 * The Equipment half of the Pariah shape (With Great Power . . . is the Aura half): a static
 * [RedirectDamage] whose `redirectTo` is [EffectTarget.EquippedCreature], resolved by
 * `DamageUtils.resolveRedirectTarget` off the Equipment's own `AttachedToComponent`.
 *
 * `Recipient.You` is the Shield's *controller*, so a control change moves the shield with
 * the Equipment. With nothing attached the redirect target resolves to null and damage is dealt to
 * you normally — the card's own ruling.
