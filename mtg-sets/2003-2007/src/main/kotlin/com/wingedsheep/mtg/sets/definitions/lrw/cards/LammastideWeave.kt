/**
 * Lammastide Weave — Lorwyn #226
 * {1}{G} · Instant
 *
 * Choose a card name, then target player mills a card. If a card with the chosen name was milled
 * this way, you gain life equal to its mana value.
 * Draw a card.
 *
 * The Aberrant Researcher / Loafing Giant idiom: `Patterns.Library.mill(1, …)` publishes the
 * milled card to the standard `"milled"` collection, and [Conditions.CollectionContainsMatch]
 * reads it back — here against [GameObjectFilter.namedFromVariable], the name the controller just
 * chose with [Effects.ChooseCardName]. Because the check is against the *gathered card* rather
 * than against the graveyard, a replacement effect that sends the milled card elsewhere still
 * pays off, which is the same reason that idiom was chosen there.
 *
 * The life gained is [DynamicAmount.ManaValueSumOfCollection] over that one-card collection.
 * A sum is exact here precisely because the mill count is one: "its mana value" has a single
 * referent, and an empty library mills nothing, matches nothing, and gains nothing.
 *
 * The name is chosen *before* the mill (printed "choose a card name, **then**"), so the chooser
 * cannot see the card first. The draw is a separate sentence and happens either way.
