/**
 * Demon's Horn
 * {2}
 * Artifact
 *
 * Whenever a player casts a black spell, you may gain 1 life.
 *
 * The black member of Darksteel's "Feather/Horn/Claw/Eye/Tooth" cycle — see [AngelsFeather] for the
 * shared shape. "A player" is every player, so the trigger is `Triggers.anyPlayer.casts(spell, requires)` (binding
 * ANY, `Player.Each`) over a colour filter, and the printed "you may" is `optional = true`, which
 * lowers to a `Gate.MayDecide` around the life gain.
