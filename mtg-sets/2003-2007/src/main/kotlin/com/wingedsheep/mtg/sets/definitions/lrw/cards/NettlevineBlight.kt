/**
 * Nettlevine Blight
 * {4}{B}{B}
 * Enchantment — Aura
 * Enchant creature or land
 * Enchanted permanent has "At the beginning of your end step, sacrifice this permanent and attach
 * Nettlevine Blight to a creature or land you control."
 *
 * The whole card turns on *who* the quoted "you" is, and the 2007-10-01 ruling spells it out: the
 * ability is granted to the enchanted permanent, so it triggers on that permanent's controller's
 * end step, that player sacrifices, and that player picks the new host from permanents *they*
 * control. Printing the ability on the Aura instead would hand every one of those to the Aura's
 * controller — precisely backwards for a card you play on an opponent's permanent, and it would
 * walk the Blight through your own board instead of eating theirs. [GrantTriggeredAbility] over the
 * default `Scope.AttachedTo` filter is what makes it right: the engine indexes a granted trigger on
 * the permanent it was granted to, so `Triggers.you.beginningOf(Step.END)`'s `Player.You` and the pipeline's
 * [CardSource.ControlledPermanents] both read that permanent's controller. Inevitable End is the
 * same shape one step smaller.
 *
 * Inside the granted ability the two nouns are *different objects*, and each has its own handle:
 *
 * - **"this permanent"** is [EffectTarget.Self] — in a granted ability, Self is the host that
 *   received the ability, not the granter.
 * - **"Nettlevine Blight"** is [EffectTarget.GrantingSource] — the Aura whose static granted this
 *   ability, captured when the trigger went on the stack. Using `Self` for both would sacrifice the
 *   host and then attach the host to something.
 *
 * [Effects.AttachTargetEquipmentToCreature] is named for the Equipment case it was written for, but
 * its executor reads neither type: it moves an `AttachedToComponent` from one permanent to another.
 * An Aura moving onto a land is exactly what it does.
 *
 * The re-attach is a resolution-time *choice*, not a target (the printed line has no "target"), so
 * it is a gather over the permanents that player controls followed by `chooseExactly(1)`. Gathering
 * *after* the sacrifice is what makes the just-sacrificed host ineligible without an explicit
 * exclusion, and `ChooseExactly`'s clamp handles the empty board: with nothing left to enchant the
 * selection is empty, `ifNotEmpty` skips the attach, and the now-hostless Aura is put into its
 * owner's graveyard by the unattached-Auras state-based action (CR 704.5m) — which runs after the
 * resolution, never inside it, so the attach above still lands while the Aura is briefly host-less.
 * That mid-resolution window is the one Breath of Fury opened (#2203).
