/**
 * Dream Leash
 * {3}{U}{U}
 * Enchantment — Aura
 * Enchant permanent
 * You can't choose an untapped permanent as this spell's target as you cast it.
 * You control enchanted permanent.
 *
 * [Confiscate] with a cast-time-only narrowing. `auraTarget` stays the printed "Enchant permanent"
 * — what the spell re-checks on resolution and what the enchant state-based action reads — and
 * `auraCastTarget` narrows only the choice made while casting to a tapped permanent. Per the
 * 2005-10-01 rulings, the permanent untapping later (in response, or once Dream Leash is on the
 * battlefield) changes nothing, and an Aura put onto the battlefield without being cast can attach
 * to an untapped permanent.
