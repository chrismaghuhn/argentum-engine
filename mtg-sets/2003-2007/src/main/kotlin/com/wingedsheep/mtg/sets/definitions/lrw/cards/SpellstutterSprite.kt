/**
 * Spellstutter Sprite
 * {1}{U}
 * Creature — Faerie Wizard
 * 1/1
 * Flash
 * Flying
 * When this creature enters, counter target spell with mana value X or less, where X is the number
 * of Faeries you control.
 *
 * Modelling notes:
 * - **The cap is a targeting restriction, not a resolution check.** It rides on the target filter as
 *   `manaValueAtMostDynamic`, so the count is read when the trigger picks a target *and* again when
 *   it resolves — exactly the 2007-10-01 ruling: if the Faerie count has dropped enough in between,
 *   the ability is countered on resolution for having no legal target and the spell resolves.
 * - **"The number of Faeries you control" is a bare tribal noun**, so it counts Faerie *permanents*,
 *   not just Faerie creatures. Lorwyn prints Kindred noncreature Faeries, and the Sprite itself is
 *   already on the battlefield when its own enters trigger resolves, so it always counts itself.
