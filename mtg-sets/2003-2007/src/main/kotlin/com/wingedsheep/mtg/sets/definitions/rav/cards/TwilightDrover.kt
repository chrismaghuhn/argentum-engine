/**
 * Twilight Drover — Ravnica: City of Guilds #33
 * {2}{W} · Creature — Spirit · Rare
 *
 * Whenever a creature token leaves the battlefield, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature.
 * {2}{W}, Remove a +1/+1 counter from this creature: Create two 1/1 white Spirit creature tokens
 * with flying.
 *
 * A token engine that turns every token's death into two more: each counter it banks buys a pair of
 * fliers, and those fliers feed it again when they go.
 *
 * **"Leaves the battlefield", not "dies".** The trigger is a bare `from = BATTLEFIELD` zone change
 * with no destination — the first ruling is explicit that where the token went doesn't matter, so
 * exile and bounce count exactly as much as the graveyard. It is [TriggerBinding.ANY]-bound and has
 * no controller predicate: an *opponent's* token leaving feeds the Drover too.
 *
 * **The token filter carries [CardPredicate.IsToken] on purpose** — this fires on creature *tokens*
 * only, so a real creature card leaving does nothing. The Drover's own Spirit tokens match it, which
 * is the loop the third ruling calls out.
 *
 * The counter is the *cost* of the token-making ability, so it is spent on activation and the
 * ability cannot be activated without one; the Drover's own tokens then pay it back as they die.
 *
 * Ravnica predates token *cards* (Scryfall has no `trav` set) and the set self-hosts art only for
 * its Saproling, so this token falls through to the engine-wide generic Spirit art — the same
 * 1/1 white flier Transluminant makes.
