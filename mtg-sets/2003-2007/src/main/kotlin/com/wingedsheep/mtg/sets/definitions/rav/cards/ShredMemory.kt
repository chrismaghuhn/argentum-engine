/**
 * Shred Memory
 * {1}{B}
 * Instant
 * Exile up to four target cards from a single graveyard.
 * Transmute {1}{B}{B}
 *
 * "From a single graveyard" is the cross-target [TargetObject.sameOwner] constraint (Arashin
 * Sunshield / Qutrub Forayer shape) — every chosen card must share an owner, checked by
 * `TargetValidator` at cast time. "Up to four" is `count = 4, optional = true`, so zero is a legal
 * choice and the spell still resolves. The payoff is a [ForEachTargetEffect] over
 * [EffectTarget.ContextTarget], since a multi-slot target requirement binds no single handle.
