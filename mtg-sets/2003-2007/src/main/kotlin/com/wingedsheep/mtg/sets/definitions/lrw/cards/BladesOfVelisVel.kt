/**
 * Blades of Velis Vel
 * {1}{R}
 * Kindred Instant — Shapeshifter
 *
 * Changeling (This card is every creature type.)
 * Up to two target creatures each get +2/+0 and gain all creature types until end of turn.
 *
 * "Up to two target creatures **each** get …" is a plural requirement, so the pump runs once per
 * chosen target ([ForEachTargetEffect] over `ContextTarget(0)`) rather than once against the
 * requirement as a whole. "Gains all creature types" is modelled by granting Changeling — the
 * engine expands that keyword into every creature type (CR 702.73).
 *
 * Note: "Tribal" was errata'd to "Kindred" in 2024.
