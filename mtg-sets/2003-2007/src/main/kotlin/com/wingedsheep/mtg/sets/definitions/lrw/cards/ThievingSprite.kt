/**
 * Thieving Sprite
 * {2}{B}
 * Creature — Faerie Rogue
 * 1/1
 *
 * Flying
 * When this creature enters, target player reveals X cards from their hand, where X is the number
 * of Faeries you control. You choose one of those cards. That player discards that card.
 *
 * Two choosers, in order, which is the whole shape of the card: the *targeted player* picks which
 * X cards to reveal, then the Sprite's *controller* picks one of those revealed cards to be
 * discarded. `ChooseExactly` clamps to the hand when the player holds fewer than X cards, which is
 * the right reading of "reveals X cards" against a small hand — they reveal their whole hand.
 *
 * The bare noun "Faeries" counts every Faerie *permanent* you control, and the Sprite itself is a
 * Faerie that has already entered when the trigger resolves, so X is at least 1 in the normal
 * case. X is counted on resolution, not on the trigger going on the stack.
