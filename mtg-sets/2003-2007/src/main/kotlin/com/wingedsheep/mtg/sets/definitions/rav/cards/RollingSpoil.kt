/**
 * Rolling Spoil — Ravnica: City of Guilds #179
 * {2}{G}{G} · Sorcery
 *
 * Destroy target land. If {B} was spent to cast this spell, all creatures get -1/-1 until end of turn.
 *
 * The Golgari entry in Ravnica's "if {X} was spent" rider cycle. "All creatures" is every creature on
 * the battlefield, yours included, so it is an unfiltered `GroupFilter(Creature)` sweep and not a
 * `youControl()` one — the group is snapshotted on resolution, which is also why a creature that
 * enters afterwards is unaffected.
 *
 * The rider follows the destruction rather than branching around it: the -1/-1 happens whether or not
 * the land actually died (a regenerated or indestructible land still leaves the sweep intact), and
 * both halves are lost together only if the single target is illegal on resolution (CR 608.2b).
