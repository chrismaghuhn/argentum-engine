/**
 * Dimir Machinations
 * {2}{B}
 * Sorcery
 * Look at the top three cards of target player's library. Exile any number of those cards, then
 * put the rest back in any order.
 * Transmute {1}{B}{B}
 *
 * The Cruel Fate shape with an unbounded split: gather the top three of the *target's* library,
 * `chooseAnyNumberSplit` so zero through three may be exiled, exile the chosen ones, and put the
 * remainder back on top of that same library. "In any order" is the default
 * `CardOrder.ControllerChooses` on `toLibraryTop` — the spell's controller orders them, not the
 * library's owner, and the ordering happens even when only one card is left (a no-op prompt the
 * engine skips).
