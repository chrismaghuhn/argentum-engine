/**
 * Myr Prototype — Mirrodin #214 (canonical printing)
 * {5} · Artifact Creature — Myr · 2/2
 *
 * At the beginning of your upkeep, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature.
 * This creature can't attack or block unless you pay {1} for each +1/+1 counter on it.
 *
 * The two lines are a single joke: every upkeep makes it bigger *and* dearer, so the price of
 * swinging is always exactly the bonus it has accumulated. That is why
 * [CantAttackOrBlockUnlessPay] takes a [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.values.DynamicAmount]
 * instead of an `Int` — a tax frozen at the printed number would be free forever.
 *
 * The tax is a *cost of declaring* it (CR 508.1a / 509.1a), not a restriction: the engine prices
 * the declaration through `CombatTaxes` and pauses for the payment, so declining to pay un-declares
 * this creature and leaves the rest of the attack standing. Attacking and blocking are charged
 * separately — a turn cycle where it does both pays twice.
