/**
 * Ceaseless Searblades
 * {3}{R}
 * Creature — Elemental Warrior
 * 2/4
 * Whenever you activate an ability of an Elemental, this creature gets +1/+0 until end of turn.
 *
 * Three readings in this one line are each load-bearing, and each one is a place the obvious
 * spelling would be wrong:
 *
 * - **"an ability" is unqualified**, so mana abilities count — `includeManaAbilities = true`, the
 *   Elrond, Moon-Reader wording, not the default "that isn't a mana ability". A Smokebraider's
 *   "{T}: Add two mana of any one color, spend this mana only to cast Elemental spells" pumps the
 *   Searblades. The pump itself can't produce mana, so this trigger is not itself a mana ability
 *   (CR 605.1b) and uses the stack normally.
 * - **"an Elemental" is the bare tribal noun**, which means an Elemental *permanent*, not an
 *   Elemental creature. Lorwyn's Kindred noncreature Elementals count: activating Hoofprints of
 *   the Stag triggers this.
 * - **`.onBattlefield()` is not decoration.** The 2007-10-01 ruling says this triggers only for an
 *   Elemental *permanent*, never for an Elemental source outside the battlefield — a card whose
 *   ability is activated from hand or graveyard. `GameObjectFilter`'s type predicates read a
 *   card's printed types in any zone, so without the state predicate a graveyard-activated
 *   Elemental would wrongly fire it.
 *
 * The trigger is unrestricted by whose Elemental it is — "you activate", not "you control": an
 * ability you activate on an Elemental you don't control still counts.
