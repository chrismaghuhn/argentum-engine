/**
 * Hunted Horror — Ravnica: City of Guilds #90
 * {B}{B} · Creature — Horror · 7/7
 *
 * Trample
 * When this creature enters, target opponent creates two 3/3 green Centaur creature tokens with
 * protection from black.
 *
 * The black member of the Hunted cycle, and the most extreme trade in it: a two-mana 7/7 trampler
 * against two 3/3s the Horror itself can never fight through. Protection from black (CR 702.16) is
 * exactly what makes the Centaurs a real answer rather than chump blockers — the Horror can't be
 * blocked *by* them profitably because they can block it and take no damage from it, and it can't
 * be targeted or enchanted by the black removal that would otherwise clear them.
 *
 * The Centaurs' protection is a [GrantProtection] on the token's own `staticAbilities`, scoped to
 * [GroupFilter.source] so it applies to the token itself rather than to something it's attached to.
 * That projects `PROTECTION_FROM_BLACK` onto the token, which is the single keyword every
 * protection leg in the engine reads — combat damage, block legality, targeting, and aura
 * attachment all consult it. (A creature *card* with printed protection uses
 * `keywordAbility(KeywordAbility.Protection(...))` instead, but a token has no printed keyword
 * abilities, so the static-ability route is the one available and the one that projects.)
 *
 * As with the rest of the cycle the tokens enter under the *targeted opponent's* control via
 * [Effects.CreateToken]'s `controller`; if the opponent is an illegal target on resolution the
 * trigger is removed from the stack and no Centaurs appear.
