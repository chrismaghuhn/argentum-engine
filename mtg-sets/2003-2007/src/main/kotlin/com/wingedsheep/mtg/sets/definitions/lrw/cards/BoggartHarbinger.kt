/**
 * Boggart Harbinger
 * {2}{B}
 * Creature — Goblin Shaman
 * 2/1
 * When this creature enters, you may search your library for a Goblin card, reveal it, then
 * shuffle and put that card on top.
 *
 * One of Lorwyn's five (plus two) Harbingers: the same tutor-to-top with a different tribe. The
 * "you may" gates the whole search: declining does not shuffle. Once accepted, the search can
 * still find no card. The filter is a *card* filter (not a creature filter), so
 * Kindred cards like Tarfire are found too.
