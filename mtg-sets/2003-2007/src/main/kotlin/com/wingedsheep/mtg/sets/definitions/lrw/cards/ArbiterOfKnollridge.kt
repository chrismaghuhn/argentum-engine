/**
 * Arbiter of Knollridge
 * {6}{W}
 * Creature — Giant Wizard
 * 5/5
 *
 * Vigilance
 * When this creature enters, each player's life total becomes the highest life total among
 * all players.
 *
 * "The highest life total among all players" is a per-player maximum, not a sum, so it reads
 * [DynamicAmount.GreatestAmongPlayers] — that combinator rebinds the measured player for each
 * seat, letting the inner `LifeTotal(Player.You)` mean "that player's life". The amount is
 * re-evaluated per player as the effect walks the seats, which is safe here precisely because
 * setting everyone to the maximum can only ever raise a life total: the maximum is a fixed
 * point of the operation, so every player lands on the same number regardless of order.
