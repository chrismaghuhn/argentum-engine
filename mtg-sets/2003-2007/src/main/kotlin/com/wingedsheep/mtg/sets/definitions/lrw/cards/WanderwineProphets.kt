/**
 * Wanderwine Prophets
 * {4}{U}{U}
 * Creature — Merfolk Wizard
 * 4/4
 *
 * Champion a Merfolk
 * Whenever this creature deals combat damage to a player, you may sacrifice a Merfolk. If you do,
 * take an extra turn after this one.
 *
 * "You may sacrifice a Merfolk. If you do, …" is [Effects.May] over [Effects.IfYouDo]: the yes/no is
 * the "may", and the extra turn is gated on the sacrifice actually happening — declining, or having
 * no Merfolk to give, takes no extra turn. The Prophets are themselves a Merfolk, so sacrificing
 * this creature to its own trigger is a legal (and printed) line.
