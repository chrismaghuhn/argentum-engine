/**
 * Dauntless Dourbark
 * {3}{G}
 * Creature — Treefolk Warrior
 * Printed power and toughness are both star (a characteristic-defining ability).
 * Dauntless Dourbark's power and toughness are each equal to the number of Forests you control
 * plus the number of Treefolk you control.
 * This creature has trample as long as you control another Treefolk.
 *
 * The CDA is a literal [DynamicAmount.Add] of two independent battlefield counts, which is what
 * the printed "plus" asks for and what the 2007-10-01 rulings require: the Dourbark counts itself
 * (it is a Treefolk you control), and a permanent that is *both* a Forest and a Treefolk is
 * counted **twice** — once by each half. Folding the two into one `withAnySubtype` filter would
 * silently count such a permanent once and get the card wrong.
 *
 * "Forests" is a land type, so that half counts lands with the Forest subtype; the bare noun
 * "Treefolk" counts every Treefolk *permanent* you control, creature or not.
 *
 * Trample is a [ConditionalStaticAbility] over `excludeSelf = true` — "another Treefolk" doesn't
 * see the Dourbark itself, so it stays correct even if the Dourbark stops being a Treefolk.
