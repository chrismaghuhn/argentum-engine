/**
 * Bramble Elemental
 * {3}{G}{G}
 * Creature — Elemental
 * 4/4
 * Whenever an Aura becomes attached to this creature, create two 1/1 green Saproling creature tokens.
 *
 * The trigger watches the *host* side of the attach, which is the ANY binding rather than the
 * default SELF one: SELF would mean "whenever **this** Aura becomes attached", and Bramble
 * Elemental is the creature being enchanted, not the Aura. `sourceItself()` on the attached-to
 * filter is what pins the host to this permanent.
 *
 * Any Aura counts, including an opponent's — the oracle text sets no controller restriction — and
 * it fires on every attach path, not just an Aura spell resolving: moving an Aura onto this
 * creature (Nomad Mythmaker, Aura Graft) attaches it too.
