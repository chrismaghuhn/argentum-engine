/**
 * Surgespanner
 * {2}{U}{U}
 * Creature — Merfolk Wizard
 * 2/2
 * Whenever this creature becomes tapped, you may pay {1}{U}. If you do, return target permanent to
 * its owner's hand.
 *
 * "You may pay {1}{U}. If you do, …" is an optional cost rider on the triggered ability itself
 * ([Effects.MayPay] → `Gate.MayPay`), not a reflexive trigger — the payment and the bounce both
 * happen as this one ability resolves. Customs Depot is the same shape.
 *
 * The target is chosen when the ability goes on the stack, before the payment is offered, which is
 * why `target` sits on the ability rather than inside the gate.
 *
 * Rulings (2007-10-01): this is a triggered ability, not an activated one — tapping has to come
 * from somewhere else (attacking, an effect). It only fires on an actual untapped → tapped change,
 * so an already-tapped Surgespanner that something tries to tap again does not trigger.
