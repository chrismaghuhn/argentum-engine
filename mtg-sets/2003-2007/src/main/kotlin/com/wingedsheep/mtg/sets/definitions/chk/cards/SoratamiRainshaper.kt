/**
 * Soratami Rainshaper

 * Creature — Moonfolk Wizard
 * 2 / 1
 *
 * Flying
 * {3}, Return a land you control to its owner's hand: Target creature you control gains shroud until
 * end of turn. (It can't be the target of spells or abilities.)
 *
 * The Moonfolk land-bounce cost is [Costs.ReturnToHand] over `GameObjectFilter.Land` composed with
 * the mana half; "you control" on the *cost* is the atom's own enumerator, while "you control" on
 * the *target* is a controller predicate on the target filter — two different you-control clauses
 * that must not be conflated. Shroud is a real [Keyword], so the grant is the keyword overload of
 * [Effects.GrantKeyword] at its default `Duration.EndOfTurn`.
