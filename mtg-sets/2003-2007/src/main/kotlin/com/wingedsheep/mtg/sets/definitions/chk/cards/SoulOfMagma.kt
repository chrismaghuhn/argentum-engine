/**
 * Soul of Magma
 * {3}{R}{R}
 * Creature — Spirit
 * 2/2
 * Whenever you cast a Spirit or Arcane spell, this creature deals 1 damage to target creature.
 *
 * The shared CHK "Whenever you cast a Spirit or Arcane spell" trigger — `Triggers.you.casts(spell, requires)`
 * over a homogeneous OR of the two subtype filters, binding `ANY` — with a mandatory ping as its
 * payoff.
 *
 * The damage source is left implicit rather than passed as an explicit `damageSource`: with no
 * override, [Effects.DealDamage] attributes the damage to the ability's own source, which is
 * exactly what "this creature deals 1 damage" means (and what makes the damage red and lifelink-
 * or deathtouch-aware should Soul of Magma ever gain either).
