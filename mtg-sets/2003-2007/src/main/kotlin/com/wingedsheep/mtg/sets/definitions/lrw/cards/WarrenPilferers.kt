/**
 * Warren Pilferers
 * {4}{B}
 * Creature — Goblin Rogue
 * 3/3
 * When this creature enters, return target creature card from your graveyard to your hand. If that
 * card is a Goblin card, this creature gains haste until end of turn.
 *
 * The Cemetery Recruitment shape: the "if that card is a Goblin card" rider is read off the *target*
 * while it is still the graveyard card, so it is a [Conditions.TargetMatchesFilter] wrapping the whole
 * resolution rather than a second effect that would have to chase the card into the hand. The haste
 * lands on the Pilferers itself ([EffectTarget.Self]), not on the returned card.
