 * The plain blink pattern — [Patterns.Exile.exileUntilEndStep] moves the target to exile and
 * schedules the step-based delayed return under its owner's control, the same primitive
 * Transluminant uses for its delayed token. A token exiled this way simply ceases to exist, per
 * the printed ruling; that falls out of the move rather than needing a special case.
