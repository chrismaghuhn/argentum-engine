/**
 * Brigid, Hero of Kinsbaile
 * {2}{W}{W}
 * Legendary Creature — Kithkin Archer
 * 2/3
 *
 * First strike
 * {T}: Brigid deals 2 damage to each attacking or blocking creature target player controls.
 *
 * The player is the only *target*; the creatures are a group gathered on resolution, so a
 * creature that joins combat after the ability was activated is still hit and one that leaves
 * simply drops out. `targetPlayerControls` binds the group's controller predicate to that
 * target rather than to Brigid's controller — pointing the ability at yourself is legal and
 * shoots your own attackers.
 *
 * `attackingOrBlocking()` is one filter carrying both state predicates as alternatives, so the
 * group holds each matching permanent exactly once and nothing takes 2 damage twice.
 *
 * Brigid is the damage source but this is not combat damage — her first strike has nothing to
 * do with it. Activated in the declare-blockers step it kills blockers before combat damage is
 * dealt, which is the whole point of the card.
