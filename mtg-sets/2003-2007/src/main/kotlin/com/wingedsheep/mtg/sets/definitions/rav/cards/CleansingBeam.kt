/**
 * Cleansing Beam
 * {4}{R}
 * Instant
 *
 * Radiance — Cleansing Beam deals 2 damage to target creature and each other creature that
 * shares a color with it.
 *
 * Radiance is an ability word: one target, and a resolution-time group relative to it. The
 * target is damaged directly; the group is every *other* creature sharing a color with the
 * target — `sharingColorWith(EffectTarget.ContextTarget(0))` for the colour test, `otherThanTarget()`
 * so the target isn't hit twice. A colorless target shares a color with nothing (Scryfall ruling
 * 2005-10-01), so only the target is damaged. The group is checked as the spell resolves, and if
 * the target has become illegal the whole spell fizzles and no other creature is affected.
