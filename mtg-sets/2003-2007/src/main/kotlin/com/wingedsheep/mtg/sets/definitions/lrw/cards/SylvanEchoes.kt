/**
 * Sylvan Echoes
 * {G}
 * Enchantment
 * Whenever you clash and win, you may draw a card.
 *
 * The clash *payoff* rather than a clash source — it never clashes itself, it watches. Two things
 * that makes load-bearing, and both are in its ruling ("if you win a clash initiated by a spell or
 * ability an opponent controls, the ability will still trigger"):
 *
 *  - The trigger is `Triggers.you.clashes(true)`, which watches the `ClashedEvent` emitted for
 *    *you as a participant*. An opponent's Adder-Staff Boggart makes you clash too, and if your
 *    revealed card is the bigger one you drew from their trigger.
 *  - The win is on the trigger, not inside the effect, because the printed wording is "clash **and
 *    win**" — losing the clash puts nothing on the stack at all.
