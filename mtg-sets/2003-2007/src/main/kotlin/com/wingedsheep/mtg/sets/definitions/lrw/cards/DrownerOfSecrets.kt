 * Drowner of Secrets

 * Creature — Merfolk Wizard
 * 1/3
 * Tap an untapped Merfolk you control: Target player mills a card.
 *
 * The cost is [Costs.TapPermanents], not the `{T}` symbol: "you control" and "untapped" are
 * carried by the atom itself, so the filter only has to say *Merfolk permanent*. Drowner is
 * itself a legal choice (no `excludeSelf`), and because tapping this way is a cost rather than
 * `{T}`, summoning sickness never applies (CR 302.6).
