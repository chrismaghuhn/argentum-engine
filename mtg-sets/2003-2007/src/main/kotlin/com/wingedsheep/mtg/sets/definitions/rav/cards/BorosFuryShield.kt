/**
 * Boros Fury-Shield — Ravnica: City of Guilds #5
 * {2}{W} · Instant
 *
 * Prevent all combat damage that would be dealt by target attacking or blocking creature this turn.
 * If {R} was spent to cast this spell, Boros Fury-Shield deals damage to that creature's controller
 * equal to the creature's power.
 *
 * The shield is directional — damage the creature *deals*, not damage dealt to it — so it is
 * `PreventAllDamageDealtBy` narrowed to [PreventionScope.CombatOnly], the same shape as Warning.
 *
 * The red rider is one of Ravnica's "if {X} was spent" clauses: the card is mono-white and the red
 * mana is a *payment* question, not a colour requirement, so a Boros land or an any-colour source
 * turns it on. `Conditions.ManaSpentToCastIncludes` reads the payment recorded on the spell, which
 * means a copy of Boros Fury-Shield — never cast, so nothing was spent for it — correctly misses
 * the rider.
 *
 * Power is read at resolution, after the shield goes up but with the creature still on the
 * battlefield, and `EffectTarget.TargetController` falls back to last-known control if it has since
 * left (CR 608.2h).
