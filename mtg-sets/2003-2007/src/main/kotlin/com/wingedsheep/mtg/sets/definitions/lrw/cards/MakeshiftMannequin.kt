/**
 * Makeshift Mannequin — Lorwyn #124
 * {3}{B} · Instant
 *
 * Return target creature card from your graveyard to the battlefield with a mannequin counter on
 * it. For as long as that creature has a mannequin counter on it, it has "When this creature
 * becomes the target of a spell or ability, sacrifice it."
 *
 * Three effects over one target handle. The reanimation is Late to Dinner's
 * [Effects.PutOntoBattlefieldFromGraveyard] (the explicit `fromZone` makes it a graveyard
 * reanimation rather than a generic blink), and the counter and the grant both name the *same*
 * target — the card keeps its id across the zone change, so both land on the permanent that just
 * entered.
 *
 * The counter is load-bearing, not flavour: the printed "for as long as that creature has a
 * mannequin counter on it" is [Duration.WhileAffectedHasCounter], so removing the counter (Hex
 * Parasite, Vampire Hexmage) really does strip the drawback. Wiring it as
 * [Duration.Permanent] would read identically on the card and be wrong in exactly that case.
 *
 * The granted ability is a plain self-bound [EventPattern.BecomesTargetEvent] — *any* spell or
 * ability, either player's, and the creature's own controller sacrifices it. Note this is one of
 * the few sacrifice riders that fires on a **friendly** targeting too, which is the whole point
 * of the card's drawback.
