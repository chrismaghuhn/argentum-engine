/**
 * Vulturous Zombie — Ravnica: City of Guilds #238
 * {3}{B}{G} · Creature — Plant Zombie · Rare
 *
 * Flying
 * Whenever a card is put into an opponent's graveyard from anywhere, put a +1/+1 counter on this
 * creature.
 *
 * The Golgari read of a graveyard: every card an opponent loses, from any zone, is food. In a
 * two-player game it grows off their removal, their discards, and every creature it kills; in a pod
 * it grows off all of it at once.
 *
 * **"From anywhere" is a bare destination filter.** The trigger is an
 * [EventPattern.ZoneChangeEvent] with `to = GRAVEYARD` and **no** `from` — the first ruling
 * enumerates the stack, the battlefield, hands and libraries precisely because the card doesn't
 * care, so pinning a source zone would be wrong. [TriggerBinding.ANY] because the moving card is
 * some other object entirely, and [CardPredicate.IsNontoken] because the second ruling is explicit
 * that a token going to a graveyard is not a card and does not trigger it.
 *
 * The graveyard is keyed by **owner**, not controller — a card always goes to its owner's graveyard
 * (CR 404.3) — so the filter is `ownedByOpponent()`, which correctly ignores an opponent's creature
 * you had stolen when it dies (it goes to *their* graveyard, so it counts) and equally ignores your
 * own card that an opponent controlled (it goes to *yours*, so it doesn't).
 *
 * This is not a batching trigger: one +1/+1 counter per card, so a five-card mill grows it by five.
