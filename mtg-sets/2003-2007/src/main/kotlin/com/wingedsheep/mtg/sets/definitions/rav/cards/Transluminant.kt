/**
 * Transluminant
 * {1}{G}
 * Creature — Dryad Shaman
 * 2/2
 *
 * {W}, Sacrifice this creature: Create a 1/1 white Spirit creature token with flying at the
 * beginning of the next end step.
 *
 * The token is not created on resolution — the ability schedules a step-based delayed trigger for
 * the next beginning-of-end-step, which is what makes the printed ruling true: activating during
 * a turn's end step has already missed that step's trigger window, so the Spirit arrives at the
 * *following* turn's end step. `fireOnPlayer` stays null because the text says "the next end
 * step", not "your next end step".
 *
 * Ravnica predates token *cards* (Scryfall has no `trav` set), and the set self-hosts art only
 * for its Saproling, so this token falls through to the engine-wide generic Spirit art.
