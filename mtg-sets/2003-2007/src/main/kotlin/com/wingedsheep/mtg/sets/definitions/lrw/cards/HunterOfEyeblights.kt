/**
 * Hunter of Eyeblights
 * {3}{B}{B}
 * Creature — Elf Assassin
 * 3/3
 * When this creature enters, put a +1/+1 counter on target creature you don't control.
 * {2}{B}, {T}: Destroy target creature with a counter on it.
 *
 * The ETB gift is how the Hunter marks its own prey — but per the 2007-10-01 ruling the activated
 * ability targets a creature with *any* kind of counter, not just the +1/+1 it just handed out, so
 * the removal filter is `withAnyCounter()` rather than a `+1/+1`-specific one.
