 * `CantSearchLibraries` on every player, then a draw. The restriction is read where a search
 * happens — a gather marked `search = true` — so looking at or revealing the top of a library
 * (the card's third ruling) and bulk library moves that aren't searches are untouched, and a
 * blocked "search …, then shuffle" still shuffles (its second ruling).
