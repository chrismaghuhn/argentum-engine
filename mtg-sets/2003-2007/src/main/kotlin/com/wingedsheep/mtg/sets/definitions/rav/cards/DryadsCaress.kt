/**
 * Dryad's Caress — Ravnica: City of Guilds #160
 * {4}{G}{G} · Instant
 *
 * You gain 1 life for each creature on the battlefield. If {W} was spent to cast this spell, untap
 * all creatures you control.
 *
 * "Each creature on the battlefield" is every creature, whoever controls it —
 * `AggregateBattlefield(Player.Each, Creature)`, the same amount Blunt the Assault counts — read on
 * resolution (CR 608.2).
 *
 * The white rider asks what was *paid*, not what colour the spell is: per the Ravnica rulings it
 * checks only that at least one {W} went into the cost, so one Plains or a Temple Garden is enough
 * and the amount doesn't matter. A copy of the spell had no mana spent for it and so never untaps.
