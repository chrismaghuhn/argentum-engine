/**
 * Leveler — Mirrodin #195
 * {5} · Artifact Creature — Juggernaut · 10/10 · Rare
 *
 * When this creature enters, exile all cards from your library.
 *
 * Modelling notes:
 * - The exile is the whole library at once, not a count: Gather [CardSource.FromZone] over
 *   `Zone.LIBRARY` for [Player.You] with no filter, then one [MoveCollectionEffect] to exile.
 *   No selection step — every card goes, so there is nothing to choose. An already-empty
 *   library gathers an empty collection and the move is a no-op.
 * - Losing the game is *not* part of the card. Per the 2021-03-19 ruling you keep playing with
 *   an empty library and only lose when you next try to draw from it (CR 104.3c), which is the
 *   engine's ordinary empty-draw state-based action — nothing card-specific to wire.
