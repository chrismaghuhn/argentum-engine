/**
 * Tunnel Vision — Ravnica: City of Guilds #72 (canonical printing)
 * {5}{U} · Sorcery
 *
 * Choose a card name. Target player reveals cards from the top of their library until a card with
 * that name is revealed. If it is, that player puts the rest of the revealed cards into their
 * graveyard and puts the card with the chosen name on top of their library. Otherwise, the player
 * shuffles.
 *
 * The Spoils of the Vault walk aimed at someone else: [Effects.ChooseCardName] stores the name and
 * [GameObjectFilter.namedFromVariable] reads it back both as the stopper for
 * [GatherUntilMatchEffect] and as the partition that separates the named card from the pile above it.
 *
 * Two details are worth stating because they are what the card actually does rather than what it
 * says:
 *
 *  - **"Puts the card with the chosen name on top of their library" needs no step.** The revealed
 *    pile is exactly the run from the top of the library down to and including the match, and
 *    nothing here moves the match. Binning everything above it leaves it on top by construction.
 *  - **The "otherwise" branch is load-bearing.** When the name isn't in the library the walk runs
 *    the library out, so the remainder pile is the *whole library*; moving it would be catastrophic
 *    rather than merely wrong. [ConditionalOnCollectionEffect] on the match pile is what keeps the
 *    two branches apart — the 2005-10-01 ruling is explicit that a miss bins nothing and shuffles.
 *
 * Choosing a name that happens to sit on top is the same code path with an empty remainder pile.
