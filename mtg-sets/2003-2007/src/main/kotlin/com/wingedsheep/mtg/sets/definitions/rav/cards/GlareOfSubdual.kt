/**
 * Glare of Subdual — Ravnica: City of Guilds #207 (canonical printing; reprinted in EMA and GK1)
 * {2}{G}{W} · Enchantment
 *
 * Tap an untapped creature you control: Tap target artifact or creature.
 *
 * A repeatable tapper whose only cost is a creature tap, so it is one `activatedAbility` with
 * `Costs.TapPermanents(1, Creature)` and nothing else — no mana, and no `{T}` of its own (the
 * enchantment never taps).
 *
 * The cost atom already carries the two restrictions the printed cost states: the creature must be
 * **untapped** and **yours**, both intrinsic to `CostAtom.TapPermanents`. Summoning sickness does
 * *not* apply — this is not a `{T}` cost of the creature's own ability, so a creature that came
 * down this turn can pay (the Convoke rule). The ability has no activation restriction, so it works
 * at instant speed and any number of times, once per untapped creature.
