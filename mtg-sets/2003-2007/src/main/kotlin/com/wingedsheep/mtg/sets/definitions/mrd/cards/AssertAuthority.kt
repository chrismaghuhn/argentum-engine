/**
 * Assert Authority — Mirrodin #30
 * {5}{U}{U} · Instant
 *
 * Affinity for artifacts (This spell costs {1} less to cast for each artifact you control.)
 * Counter target spell. If that spell is countered this way, exile it instead of putting it into
 * its owner's graveyard.
 *
 * Two existing primitives, no engine work: [KeywordAbility.Affinity] over [CardType.ARTIFACT]
 * (Thoughtcast's cost reduction — generic mana only, so the floor is {U}{U}) plus
 * [Effects.CounterSpellToExile], the Dissipate counter whose `CounterDestination.Exile` sends the
 * countered spell to exile instead of its owner's graveyard.
 *
 * Affinity is a cost reduction, not an alternative cost, so mana value stays 7 in every zone no
 * matter how many artifacts paid for it.
