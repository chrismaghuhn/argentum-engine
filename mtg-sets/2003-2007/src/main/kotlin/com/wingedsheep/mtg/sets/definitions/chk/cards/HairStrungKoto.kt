/**
 * Hair-Strung Koto
 * {6}
 * Artifact
 *
 * Tap an untapped creature you control: Target player mills a card.
 *
 * The cost is [Costs.TapPermanents], not [Costs.Tap] — the Koto itself is never tapped; tapping a
 * creature *as a cost* rather than paying the `{T}` symbol means summoning sickness never applies
 * (CR 302.6) and only untapped permanents may be chosen (CR 701.26a). "You control" and "untapped"
 * are carried by the atom, so the filter only has to say *creature*; the artifact is not itself a
 * legal choice because it isn't one. Same shape as `chk/cards/AzamiLadyOfScrolls.kt` and
 * `lrw/cards/DrownerOfSecrets.kt`.
