/**
 * Pollenbright Wings
 * {4}{G}{W}
 * Enchantment — Aura
 * Enchant creature
 * Enchanted creature has flying.
 * Whenever enchanted creature deals combat damage to a player, create that many 1/1 green
 * Saproling creature tokens.
 *
 * "That many" is the damage the *enchanted* creature dealt, so the trigger is the ordinary
 * combat-damage-to-a-player event read one object out — [TriggerBinding.ATTACHED] — and the
 * token count is [ContextPropertyKey.TRIGGER_DAMAGE_AMOUNT], the same payload
 * [com.wingedsheep.mtg.sets.definitions.ons.cards.BroodhatchNantuko] counts its Insects with.
 * The tokens are created under the Aura's controller, not the enchanted creature's — that is
 * `CreateTokenEffect`'s default, and it is what makes stealing a creature with this Aura work.
