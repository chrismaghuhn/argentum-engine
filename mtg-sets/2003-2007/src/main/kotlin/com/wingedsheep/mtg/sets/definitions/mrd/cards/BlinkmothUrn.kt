/**
 * Blinkmoth Urn — Mirrodin #145 (canonical and earliest real-expansion printing)
 * {5} · Artifact
 *
 * At the beginning of each player's first main phase, if this artifact is untapped, that player
 * adds {C} for each artifact they control.
 *
 * The trigger watches every player's precombat main phase. [Effects.ForEachPlayer] rebinds the
 * effect controller to the active player, so both [Player.You] in the artifact count and the mana
 * recipient mean "that player," even on an opponent's turn. [Conditions.SourceIsUntapped] is the
 * intervening-if gate, checked both when the ability would trigger and again when it resolves.
