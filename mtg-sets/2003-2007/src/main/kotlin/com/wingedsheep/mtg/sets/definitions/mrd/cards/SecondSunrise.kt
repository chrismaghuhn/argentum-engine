/**
 * Second Sunrise — Mirrodin #20
 * {1}{W}{W} · Instant · Rare
 *
 * Each player returns to the battlefield all artifact, creature, enchantment, and land cards in
 * their graveyard that were put there from the battlefield this turn.
 *
 * One Gather → Move pipeline over `Player.Each` (the same all-graveyards sweep Rise of the Dark
 * Realms uses), with two details that carry the card's whole meaning:
 *
 *  - **`putIntoGraveyardFromBattlefieldThisTurn()`** is the "put there from the battlefield this
 *    turn" clause. The predicate reads the per-card `PutIntoGraveyardThisTurnComponent` that
 *    `ZoneTransitionService` stamps on every graveyard arrival and strips when the card leaves, so a
 *    creature milled this turn — or one that died two turns ago — is correctly skipped. The
 *    component is wiped at each untap step, which is what makes it per-turn.
 *  - **`underOwnersControl = true`** is "*each player* returns … in *their* graveyard". Unlike a
 *    reanimation spell, Second Sunrise hands nothing to its caster: every card comes back under its
 *    own owner's control (CR 610.3c), including the opponents' dead.
 *
 * The type list is spelled out as an explicit union rather than `GameObjectFilter.Permanent`
 * because the printed text names exactly four types — a planeswalker or battle card that hit the
 * graveyard from the battlefield this turn stays there.
