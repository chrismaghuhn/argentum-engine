/**
 * Sire of the Storm
 * {4}{U}{U}
 * Creature — Spirit
 * 3/3
 * Flying
 * Whenever you cast a Spirit or Arcane spell, you may draw a card.
 *
 * The blue half of the CHK "Whenever you cast a Spirit or Arcane spell" cycle: the shared
 * `Triggers.you.casts(spell, requires)` over a homogeneous OR of the two subtype filters, binding `ANY`.
 *
 * The printed "you may" is the builder's `optional = true`, which lowers to a `Gate.MayDecide`
 * around the draw. The "may" matters here rather than being flavour: the trigger goes on the
 * stack even with an empty library, and declining is what keeps a Sire from decking its own
 * controller.
