/**
 * Sisters of Stone Death — Ravnica: City of Guilds #231
 * {4}{B}{B}{G}{G} · Legendary Creature — Gorgon 7/5 · Rare
 *
 * {G}: Target creature blocks Sisters of Stone Death this turn if able.
 * {B}{G}: Exile target creature blocking or blocked by Sisters of Stone Death.
 * {2}{B}: Put a creature card exiled with Sisters of Stone Death onto the battlefield under your
 * control.
 *
 * Modelling notes:
 * - The first ability is [Effects.ForceBlock] with the default `attacker = Self` — the same
 *   "blocks *it* this turn if able" requirement Avalanche Tusker's attack trigger creates, here
 *   behind a mana cost instead. It is a requirement, not a guarantee (CR 509.1c): a creature that
 *   can't legally block the Sisters simply doesn't, and the requirement is only read while the
 *   Sisters are actually attacking. The ability may be activated before attackers are declared
 *   (the effect lasts the turn), so the executor must not demand that the Sisters already be
 *   attacking when it resolves.
 * - "Blocking or blocked by" is [GameObjectFilter.blockingOrBlockedBySource] — the live
 *   combat-pairing predicate Spitting Slug uses, read at targeting time and again on resolution.
 * - The second and third abilities are *linked* (CR 607): the exile writes the Sisters' linked
 *   exile pile and the return gathers from it, so nothing else that has ever been exiled is
 *   reachable. Per the ruling, any creature card ever exiled by the second ability can come back,
 *   whenever it was exiled, but a non-creature card (an animated land) never can — that is the
 *   `filter = Creature` on the selection, not on the gather.
 * - "Put a creature card" is one card, mandatory when one exists: `chooseExactly(1)` clamps to
 *   zero when the pile holds no creature card, which is the printed behaviour of an empty pile.
