 * 3/4
 * Reach
 * Whenever you cast a Spirit or Arcane spell, this creature gains forestwalk until end of turn.
 *
 * The same "Whenever you cast a Spirit or Arcane spell" trigger the rest of the CHK Spirit cycle
 * carries — `Triggers.you.casts(spell, requires)` over a homogeneous OR of the two subtype filters, binding
 * `ANY` — with the payoff pointed at the source rather than at a target.
 *
 * [EffectTarget.Self] is the right handle here, not `TriggeringEntity`: the entity bound by a
 * spell-cast trigger is the *spell*, and "this creature gains forestwalk" names the permanent
 * whose ability it is.
