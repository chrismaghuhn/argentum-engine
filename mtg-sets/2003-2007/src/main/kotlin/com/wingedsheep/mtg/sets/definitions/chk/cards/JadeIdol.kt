/**
 * Jade Idol
 * {4}
 * Artifact
 * Whenever you cast a Spirit or Arcane spell, this artifact becomes a 4/4 Spirit artifact creature until end of turn.
 *
 * The Kamigawa "Whenever you cast a Spirit or Arcane spell" trigger is a `SpellCastEvent` watching
 * *your* casts with an OR over the two subtypes — `withAnySubtype` builds the single
 * `CardPredicate.Or` the grammar expects, rather than the `anyOf` branch list that the `or` infix
 * on `GameObjectFilter` would produce. `Triggers.you.casts(spell, requires)` supplies `Player.You` and
 * `TriggerBinding.ANY`, so Jade Idol also animates off its own cast — though it is not itself a
 * Spirit or Arcane spell, so in practice that only matters for a copy or a text-changing effect.
 *
 * The animation is additive: `BecomeCreature` with no `removeTypes` leaves the Artifact type in
 * place and `addTypes = setOf("ARTIFACT")` restates it, matching the printed "artifact creature".
 * The default `target` is `EffectTarget.Self` (the Idol) and the default duration is end of turn.
