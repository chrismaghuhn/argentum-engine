/**
 * Sword of Kaldra — Mirrodin #251 (canonical printing, only printing)
 * {4} · Legendary Artifact — Equipment
 *
 * Equipped creature gets +5/+5.
 * Whenever equipped creature deals damage to a creature, exile that creature.
 * Equip {4}
 *
 * The first piece of the Kaldra cycle (with [com.wingedsheep.mtg.sets.definitions.dst.cards.ShieldOfKaldra]
 * and Helm of Kaldra in Darksteel).
 *
 * The trigger is [TriggerBinding.ATTACHED] over `DamageType.Any` — *any* damage, not just combat, so
 * it fires on a Viridian Longbow ping as readily as on a block. `Recipient.AnyCreature` narrows
 * it to damage dealt to creatures, and [EffectTarget.TriggeringEntity] is the *damaged* creature: a
 * damage trigger stamps the recipient as the triggering entity, which is what "exile that creature"
 * refers to. The printed reminder "(Exile it only if it's still on the battlefield)" needs no wiring —
 * a creature that already died to the damage is simply no longer there to move.
