/**
 * Flickerform
 * {1}{W}
 * Enchantment — Aura
 * Enchant creature
 * {2}{W}{W}: Exile enchanted creature and all Auras attached to it. At the beginning of the next
 * end step, return that card to the battlefield under its owner's control. If you do, return the
 * other cards exiled this way to the battlefield under their owners' control attached to that
 * creature.
 *
 * The host and its Auras (Flickerform among them) are gathered into two collections while still
 * attached, then exiled. The end-step trigger carries both collections
 * (`CreateDelayedTriggerEffect.carryCollections`), returns the host under its owner's control, then
 * returns the Auras with `MoveCollectionEffect.attachTo` naming that card. `attachTo` requires the
 * host to be on the battlefield, which is the "if you do": a token host ceased to exist in exile,
 * so its Auras stay exiled (2005-10-01 ruling), and an Aura that can't legally enchant the returned
 * card stays exiled too. A bestow card isn't an Aura card in exile, so it returns as a creature.
