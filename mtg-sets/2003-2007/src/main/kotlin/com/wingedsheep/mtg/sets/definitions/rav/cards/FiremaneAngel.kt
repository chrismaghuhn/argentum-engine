/**
 * Firemane Angel
 * {3}{R}{W}{W}
 * Creature — Angel
 * 4/3
 *
 * Flying, first strike
 * At the beginning of your upkeep, if Firemane Angel is in your graveyard or on the battlefield,
 * you may gain 1 life.
 * {6}{R}{R}{W}{W}: Return this card from your graveyard to the battlefield.
 * Activate only during your upkeep.
 *
 * The life trigger is the Edgar Markov shape, and for the same two rules. CR 113.6b — "an ability
 * that states which zones it functions in functions only from those zones" — is
 * `triggerZones = {GRAVEYARD, BATTLEFIELD}`, which is what makes the upkeep trigger fire off a dead
 * Angel at all. The identical printed clause is *also* an intervening-"if" (CR 603.4), checked a
 * second time as the ability resolves, and that second check is [Conditions.SourceInZone]. The two
 * halves are what the 2017-11-17 ruling turns on: an Angel that dies or is reanimated during your
 * upkeep after the trigger goes on the stack is a new object in a new zone, and you gain no life.
 *
 * The recursion is the ordinary graveyard-activation shape (Grim Reminder's template):
 * `activateFromZone = Zone.GRAVEYARD` plus the your-turn/upkeep restriction pair, with the return
 * an explicit `fromZone = GRAVEYARD` move so a card that has already left cannot be moved twice.
 * Nothing links the two abilities — reanimating the Angel does not "use up" the life trigger, it
 * just moves the card out from under it.
