/**
 * Militia's Pride
 * {1}{W}
 * Kindred Enchantment — Kithkin
 *
 * Whenever a nontoken creature you control attacks, you may pay {W}. If you do, create a 1/1 white
 * Kithkin Soldier creature token that's tapped and attacking.
 *
 * The trigger is per-attacker and `ANY`-bound — one instance for each nontoken attacker, not one
 * for the attack as a whole — so a three-creature alpha strike offers the payment three times.
 * The `nontoken()` half is what stops the tokens it makes from triggering it again.
 *
 * "You may pay {W}. If you do, …" is an optional cost rider on the triggered ability itself
 * ([Effects.MayPay] → `Gate.MayPay`), resolved as the ability resolves — Customs Depot's shape.
 *
 * The token enters tapped and attacking, so it was never declared as an attacker: it doesn't
 * re-trigger this enchantment, and "whenever a creature attacks" triggers elsewhere don't see it
 * either (CR 508.4).
 *
 * Note: "Tribal" was errata'd to "Kindred" in 2024.
