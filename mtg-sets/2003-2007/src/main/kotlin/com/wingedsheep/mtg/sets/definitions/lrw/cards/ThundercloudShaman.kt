/**
 * Thundercloud Shaman
 * {3}{R}{R}
 * Creature — Giant Shaman
 * 4/4
 * When this creature enters, it deals damage equal to the number of Giants you control to each
 * non-Giant creature.
 *
 * Two different readings of "Giant" in one line, and they are not the same set. The *amount* is the
 * bare tribal noun — every Giant permanent you control, the Shaman itself included, so the sweep is
 * at least 1. The *victims* are "each non-Giant creature", which is creatures only and spans every
 * player's battlefield: the Shaman burns its controller's own non-Giants too.
 *
 * The count is read once as the ability resolves, before any damage is dealt, and state-based
 * actions aren't checked mid-resolution — so a Giant dying to this sweep can't shrink it.
