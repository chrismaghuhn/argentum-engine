/**
 * Phytohydra — Ravnica: City of Guilds #218 (canonical printing; reprinted in RVR)
 * {2}{G}{W}{W} · Creature — Plant Hydra · 1/1
 *
 * If damage would be dealt to this creature, put that many +1/+1 counters on it instead.
 *
 * One [ReplaceDamageWithCounters] with `Recipient.Self` — the Anti-Venom clause, unchanged.
 * The "instead" matters and the primitive already gets it right (CR 614.1a): the damage is
 * *replaced*, never dealt and never prevented. Two rulings fall out of that for free:
 *
 * - "Phytohydra's ability doesn't prevent damage. Damage that can't be prevented will still be
 *   replaced by +1/+1 counters" (2024-01-12) — a replacement, not a prevention shield, so
 *   Excruciator-style unpreventable damage still turns into counters.
 * - First strike gets the counters in the first-strike damage step, before Phytohydra deals its own
 *   damage in the second (2005-10-01) — nothing special-cased; the replacement runs per damage
 *   event on whichever step deals it.
 *
 * The counter recipient defaults to the replacement's own host, which here is also the damaged
 * permanent, so the default is the printed "on it".
