/**
 * Mindmoil
 * {4}{R}
 * Enchantment
 * Whenever you cast a spell, put the cards in your hand on the bottom of your library in any
 * order, then draw that many cards.
 *
 * A Gather → Move → Draw pipeline: the whole hand is gathered into one collection, moved to the
 * bottom of the library with [CardOrder.ControllerChooses] for the printed "in any order", and
 * the draw counts that same collection. Counting the collection rather than the hand is what
 * makes "that many" the hand size *before* the shuffle-back — the count is read by entity id, so
 * it survives the cards having already left the hand.
 *
 * The spell that triggered this is on the stack, not in hand, so it is never bottomed — and the
 * trigger resolves before the spell does.
