/**
 * Spinerock Knoll
 * Land
 *
 * Hideaway 4 (When this land enters, look at the top four cards of your library, exile
 * one face down, then put the rest on the bottom in a random order.)
 * This land enters tapped.
 * {T}: Add {R}.
 * {R}, {T}: You may play the exiled card without paying its mana cost if an opponent was
 * dealt 7 or more damage this turn.
 *
 * Same shape as [MosswortBridge] — see its comment for how hideaway is composed. The gate is
 * "an opponent was dealt 7 or more damage this turn": an *existential* over opponents, so it
 * reads [DynamicAmount.GreatestAmongPlayers] rather than a plain per-opponent tracker. Summing
 * `DAMAGE_RECEIVED` across `Player.EachOpponent` would let three opponents on 3 damage each
 * satisfy a 7-damage threshold no single one of them reached; taking the greatest measures each
 * opponent separately, which is what the card asks. Damage of any kind counts, combat or not
 * (2007-10-01 ruling), which is why this is `DAMAGE_RECEIVED` and not the combat-only tracker.
