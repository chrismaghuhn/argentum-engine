 * Creature — Elemental
 * 5/3
 * Vanishing 1
 * Whenever a creature you control deals combat damage to a player, put a time counter on this creature.
 *
 * The counter goes on **Lavacore**, not on the creature that connected, so this is one observer
 * trigger on Lavacore with a `sourceFilter` — *not* a `GrantTriggeredAbility` to your creatures,
 * where `EffectTarget.Self` would resolve to the grantee and put the counter on the wrong
 * permanent. Vanishing 1 makes the distinction load-bearing: the wrong reading never refuels it.
