/**
 * Cryptic Command
 * {1}{U}{U}{U}
 * Instant
 * Choose two —
 * • Counter target spell.
 * • Return target permanent to its owner's hand.
 * • Tap all creatures your opponents control.
 * • Draw a card.
 *
 * The Lorwyn Command cycle's blue member, and the same `modal(chooseCount = 2)` shape as its
 * white sibling [AustereCommand]. Two of the four modes target, so those two declare their
 * requirement inside their own `mode` block and the other two declare none — the engine collects
 * the chosen modes' requirements at cast time, which is what the 2017-11-17 ruling about "look at
 * both chosen modes to determine how many targets" describes.
