/**

 * Instant
 *
 * Target creature becomes the color or colors of your choice until end of turn.
 * Draw a card.
 *
 * "The color **or colors** of your choice" is [Effects.ChooseColorsThen] — the multi-color form of
 * `ChooseColorThen`, whose decision lets the caster pick any nonempty set of colors (ruling: any
 * single color or any combination, never colorless). [Effects.ChangeColorToChosen] then replaces the
 * target's colors with the whole chosen set in layer 5 until end of turn. The color choice is made
 * on resolution, and only if the target is still legal — an illegal target fizzles the spell, so
 * neither the recolor nor the draw happens.
