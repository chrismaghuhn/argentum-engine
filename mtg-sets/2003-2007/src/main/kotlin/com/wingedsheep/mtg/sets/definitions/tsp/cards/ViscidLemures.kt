 * Creature — Spirit
 * 4 / 3

 * {0}: This creature gets -1/-0 and gains swampwalk until end of turn. (It can't be blocked as long
 * as defending player controls a Swamp.)
 *
 * Both halves of the ability last until end of turn, so the shrink and the grant are one composite:
 * the bare [Keyword.SWAMPWALK] grant is enough — the engine's landwalk handling synthesizes the
 * blocking restriction.
