/**
 * Weed Strangle
 * {3}{B}{B}
 * Sorcery
 *
 * Destroy target creature. Clash with an opponent. If you win, you gain life equal to that
 * creature's toughness.
 *
 * The life gain reads a creature that the spell's own earlier step already destroyed, so the
 * toughness has to be **frozen before the move**: [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.targets.EffectTarget.ContextTarget]
 * is deliberately `LIVE_ONLY` (a departed target reads as absent, CR 608.2b), and there is no
 * target LKI snapshot to fall back on. The pipeline's `storeNumber` evaluates
 * [DynamicAmounts.targetToughness] once, up front, and the win rider reads it back through
 * the number handle's `amount`. That also matches the printed intent — the creature's
 * toughness as it last existed on the battlefield — and stays correct for an indestructible or
 * regenerated target, which is still on the board but whose toughness the freeze already captured.
 *
 * Freezing *before* the clash rather than inside the win branch matters for a second reason: the
 * clash pauses twice for the two top-or-bottom decisions, and the read happens on the far side of
 * both, inside the gate's `then`. The store therefore has to survive a gated pause, which is
 * exactly what `WeedStrangleScenarioTest` forces with two clash-legal libraries.
