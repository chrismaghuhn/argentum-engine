/**
 * Immaculate Magistrate
 * {3}{G}
 * Creature — Elf Shaman
 * 2/2
 * {T}: Put a +1/+1 counter on target creature for each Elf you control.
 *
 * The count is a [Effects.AddDynamicCounters] amount, so it is read when the ability *resolves*
 * (2020-11-10 ruling) rather than on activation — Elves arriving or leaving in response change
 * how many counters land. The target is any creature, not just an Elf (same ruling), and the
 * Magistrate itself is an Elf, so it always contributes at least one.
