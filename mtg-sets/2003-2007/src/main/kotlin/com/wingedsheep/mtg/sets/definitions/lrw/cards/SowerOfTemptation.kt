/**
 * Sower of Temptation
 * {2}{U}{U}
 * Creature — Faerie Wizard
 * 2/2
 * Flying
 * When this creature enters, gain control of target creature for as long as this creature
 * remains on the battlefield.
 *
 * The control change is a CR 611.2b "for as long as …" continuous effect, so it rides
 * [Duration.WhileSourceOnBattlefield] keyed to Sower rather than being a static ability on Sower
 * itself: the effect belongs to the resolving enters trigger, and `EndedDurationExpiryCheck`
 * hands the creature back the instant Sower leaves the battlefield.
 *
 * The duration matters more than it looks. Because the grab is a one-shot trigger with a
 * source-keyed duration and *not* a static ability, killing Sower in response to the trigger
 * means the trigger resolves with its duration already ended — the creature is never stolen at
 * all (its own ruling). Bouncing Sower after the fact likewise returns the creature immediately,
 * and a second Sower entering later starts a fresh, independent grab.
