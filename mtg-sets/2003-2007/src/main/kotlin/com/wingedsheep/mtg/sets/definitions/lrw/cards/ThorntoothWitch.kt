/**
 * Thorntooth Witch
 * {5}{B}
 * Creature — Treefolk Shaman
 * 3/4
 * Whenever you cast a Treefolk spell, you may have target creature get +3/-3 until end of turn.
 *
 * `Triggers.you.casts(GameObjectFilter.Any.withSubtype(subtype))` matches the *spell's* subtype, so a Kindred card with the Treefolk type
 * triggers it as much as a Treefolk creature spell does — which is what the printed noun says.
 *
 * "You may have" is the ability's `optional` shorthand, which lowers to a `Gate.MayDecide` around
 * the pump: the target is chosen as the trigger goes on the stack and the choice to use it is made
 * on resolution, so a target that has left by then simply fizzles.
