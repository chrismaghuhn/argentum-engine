/**
 * Netherborn Phalanx
 * {5}{B}
 * Creature — Horror
 * 2/4
 * When this creature enters, each opponent loses 1 life for each creature they control.
 * Transmute {1}{B}{B}
 *
 * "Each opponent loses 1 life for each creature *they* control" is a per-player amount, not one
 * total, so it is a [Effects.ForEachPlayer] sweep over [Player.EachOpponent] rather than a single
 * `LoseLife` with a global count. Each iteration rebinds the controller, which makes
 * [EffectTarget.Controller] the opponent being processed and `Player.You` inside the
 * [DynamicAmount.Count] *that same* opponent — so a player with three creatures loses 3 while a
 * player with none loses 0, instead of both losing the table-wide total.
