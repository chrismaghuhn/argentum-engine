/**
 * Blood Funnel
 * {1}{B}
 * Enchantment
 * Noncreature spells you cast cost {2} less to cast.
 * Whenever you cast a noncreature spell, counter that spell unless you sacrifice a creature.
 *
 * A discount you pay for in bodies. The two halves are independent: the reduction is a plain
 * [ModifySpellCost] on noncreature spells you cast, and the tax is the punisher shape —
 * [PayOrSufferEffect] with a sacrifice cost and, as the *suffer* branch, a [CounterEffect] aimed
 * at [CounterTargetSource.TriggeringEntity] (the spell that just triggered it).
 *
 * `PayOrSufferEffect` checks affordability before prompting, so a controller with no creature
 * isn't offered an impossible "sacrifice?" — their spell is simply countered. Note that the
 * trigger fires on *every* noncreature spell you cast, discounted or not: casting one with the
 * Funnel out always demands a creature.
 *
 * The trigger resolves above the spell that caused it, so the sacrifice happens (and the spell
 * dies) before that spell would resolve.
