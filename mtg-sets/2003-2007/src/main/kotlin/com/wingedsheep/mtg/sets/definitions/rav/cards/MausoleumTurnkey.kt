/**
 * Mausoleum Turnkey — Ravnica: City of Guilds #94
 * {3}{B} · Creature — Ogre Rogue · Uncommon · 3/2
 *
 * When this creature enters, return target creature card of an opponent's choice from your
 * graveyard to your hand.
 *
 * Modelling notes:
 * - The whole card is one enters trigger over the existing `Effects.ReturnToHand`. The only new
 *   thing is **who picks the target**: `TargetChooser.Opponent` existed and was honored on
 *   *activated* abilities only (Cuombajj Witches), with `CardLinter` failing any card that put it
 *   on a triggered one. This card is the printed triggered use, so the trigger path now pins the
 *   deciding opponent the same way the activated path does.
 * - The chooser is **orthogonal to legality** (see `TargetChooser`): the legal targets are still
 *   found relative to *this* card's controller, so "from your graveyard" stays your graveyard. The
 *   opponent only picks which of those cards comes back — which is the whole point of the card, and
 *   why it can't be modelled as an opponent-controlled effect.
 * - Mandatory, not "may": with a creature card in your graveyard the trigger goes on the stack and
 *   an opponent must name one. With none, no legal target exists and the trigger is removed from
 *   the stack (CR 603.3d) — nothing to decline.
 * - With three or more opponents the controller first picks *which* opponent decides, then that
 *   opponent picks the card. In a two-player game the engine skips straight to the only opponent.
