/**
 * Boggart Shenanigans
 * {2}{R}
 * Kindred Enchantment — Goblin
 * Whenever another Goblin you control is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, you may have
 * this enchantment deal 1 damage to target player or planeswalker.
 *
 * The bare tribal noun "Goblin" names every permanent with the subtype, so the filter is
 * [GameObjectFilter.Permanent] rather than Creature — Boggart Shenanigans is itself a Goblin, and
 * that is what the "another" ([TriggerBinding.OTHER]) is guarding against. "A graveyard", not
 * "your graveyard": a Goblin you control but don't own still triggers this on the way to its own
 * owner's graveyard, so the filter reads control and the destination is left unqualified.
 *
 * The target is chosen when the ability goes on the stack; the "you may" is asked at resolution.
