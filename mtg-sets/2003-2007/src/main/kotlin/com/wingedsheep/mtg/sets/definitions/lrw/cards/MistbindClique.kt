/**
 * Mistbind Clique
 * {3}{U}
 * Creature — Faerie Wizard
 * 4/4
 *
 * Flash
 * Flying
 * Champion a Faerie
 * When a Faerie is championed with this creature, tap all lands target player controls.
 *
 * The follow-up is a real triggered ability keyed to the CR 702.72c "championed" event
 * (`Triggers.self.champions()`), not a rider on the champion trigger itself. That is what makes the
 * printed line behave: it fires only when a Faerie was *actually* exiled (declining the champion
 * choice sacrifices the Clique and taps nothing), it is a separate object on the stack that can be
 * responded to, and its player target is chosen when it goes on the stack rather than when the
 * Clique enters. The "a Faerie" quality needs no restating — the champion clause above can only
 * ever exile a Faerie permanent.
 *
 * "Tap all lands target player controls" is a group tap: gather the target player's lands, then
 * [TapUntapCollectionEffect]. The lands are not targeted — only the player is.
