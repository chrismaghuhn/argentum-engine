 * Keldon Marauders

 * Creature — Human Warrior
 * 3/3
 * Vanishing 2
 * When this creature enters or leaves the battlefield, it deals 1 damage to target player or planeswalker.
 *
 * "Enters **or** leaves" is two triggered abilities; the leave half fires off last-known
 * information, which is why vanishing's sacrifice still gets the second ping in.
