 * Ivory Giant
 * {5}{W}{W}
 * Creature — Giant
 * 3 / 4
 * When this creature enters, tap all nonwhite creatures.
 * Suspend 5—{W} (Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay {W} and exile it with five time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, you may cast it without paying its mana cost. It has haste.)
 *
 * "Tap all nonwhite creatures" is symmetric — no controller predicate — so it is
 * [Effects.ForEachInGroup] over `Creature.notColor(WHITE)` with [Effects.Tap] on
 * [EffectTarget.IterationEntity], which inside the loop resolves to the current iteration entity.
