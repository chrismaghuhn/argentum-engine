/**
 * Woodwraith Corrupter
 * {3}{B}{B}{G}
 * Creature — Elemental Horror
 * 3/6
 *
 * {1}{B}{G}, {T}: Target Forest becomes a 4/4 black and green Elemental Horror creature.
 * It's still a land.
 *
 * The animation has **no stated duration**, so it is [Duration.Permanent] — the 2005-10-01 ruling
 * spells it out: "a land turned into a creature this way continues being a creature as long as the
 * land is on the battlefield". Corrupting the same Forest twice is harmless; the later timestamp
 * simply re-applies the identical Layer 4/5/7b effect.
 *
 * "It's still a land" is [Effects.BecomeCreature]'s default — CREATURE and the two subtypes are
 * *added* without removing LAND or the Forest subtype, so the animated Forest still taps for {G}.
 * Any Forest is a legal target, including an opponent's, and any land with the Forest subtype
 * qualifies (a Stomping Ground, a Murmuring Bosk), not only the basic.
 *
 * Setting `colors` overwrites the land's colors in Layer 5 rather than adding to them — which is
 * what "becomes a black and green … creature" says. The animated Forest can then be hit by a
 * "destroy target black creature" and, being a creature that entered this turn, cannot attack or
 * pay a {T} cost until its controller's next turn (the 2008-08-01 summoning-sickness ruling).
