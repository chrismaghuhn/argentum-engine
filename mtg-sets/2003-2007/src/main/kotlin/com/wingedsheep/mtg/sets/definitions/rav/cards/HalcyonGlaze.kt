/**
 * Halcyon Glaze
 * {1}{U}{U}
 * Enchantment
 * Whenever you cast a creature spell, this enchantment becomes a 4/4 Illusion creature with flying
 * in addition to its other types until end of turn.
 *
 * "In addition to its other types" is [Effects.BecomeCreature]'s default: it adds CREATURE and
 * leaves the printed types alone, so the animated Halcyon Glaze is an Enchantment Creature — an
 * enchantment-removal spell still answers it, and it still counts as an enchantment for constellation
 * and the like.
 *
 * The trigger resolves *before* the creature spell that caused it (both are on the stack, the
 * trigger on top), so the animation is already live when the creature enters. It fires on the cast,
 * not the resolution — countering the creature spell doesn't undo it.
