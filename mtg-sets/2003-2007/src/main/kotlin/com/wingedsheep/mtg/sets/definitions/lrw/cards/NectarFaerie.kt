 * Nectar Faerie

 * Creature — Faerie Wizard
 * 1/1
 * Flying
 * {B}, {T}: Target Faerie or Elf gains lifelink until end of turn.
 *
 * The target names no card type and no controller: it is any *permanent* that is a Faerie or an
 * Elf, an opponent's included, and in Lorwyn that reaches the Kindred noncreature permanents
 * (a Kindred Enchantment — Faerie is a Faerie) as well as creatures. So the filter is
 * [GameObjectFilter.Permanent] with a [GameObjectFilter.withAnySubtype] union, not
 * `GameObjectFilter.Creature` — one noun phrase, one filter, the way Goblin Wizard's
 * "target Goblin" is written.
