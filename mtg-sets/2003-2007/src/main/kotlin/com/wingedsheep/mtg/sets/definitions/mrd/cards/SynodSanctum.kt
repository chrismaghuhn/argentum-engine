/**
 * Synod Sanctum — Mirrodin #252
 * {1} · Artifact · Uncommon
 *
 * {2}, {T}: Exile target permanent you control.
 * {2}, Sacrifice this artifact: Return all cards exiled with this artifact to the battlefield
 * under your control.
 *
 * Modelling notes:
 * - The two abilities are *linked* (CR 607): the second one can only find what the first one
 *   exiled. That link is the exile's `linkToSource = true` plus the matching
 *   [CardSource.FromLinkedExile] gather — the same pairing Northampton Farm uses — not a
 *   "cards in exile" scan, which would wrongly scoop up other players' exiled cards.
 * - The return is "all cards", so there is no selection step: gather the linked exile and move
 *   the whole collection. An empty linked exile makes the ability a legal but empty activation.
 * - `CardDestination.ToZone(Zone.BATTLEFIELD, Player.You)` is what makes it "under **your**
 *   control" — the exiled permanents may have been targets you owned but a returned card comes
 *   back under the activating player's control regardless of owner.
 * - Sacrificing the Sanctum is a *cost*, so it is already gone when the ability resolves. The
 *   linked exile is keyed to the object that exiled the cards, which is why the ability can
 *   still find them (CR 607.2 last-known-information; the same shape as Northampton Farm).
