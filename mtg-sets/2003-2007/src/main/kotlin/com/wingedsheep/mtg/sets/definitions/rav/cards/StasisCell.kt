/**
 * Stasis Cell
 * {4}{U}
 * Enchantment — Aura
 *
 * Enchant creature
 * Enchanted creature doesn't untap during its controller's untap step.
 * {3}{U}: Attach this Aura to target creature.
 *
 * The lock is the shared [AbilityFlag.DOESNT_UNTAP] grant onto the enchanted creature (Shackles'
 * shape) — `BeginningPhaseManager.performUntapStep` skips any permanent whose projected keywords
 * carry the flag, so the restriction follows the Aura when it moves rather than staying on the old
 * host.
 *
 * Moving the Aura is `Effects.AttachEquipment` aimed at the ability's own target: that effect is
 * attachment-generic (it rewrites `AttachedToComponent` / `AttachmentsComponent` and detaches from
 * the previous host first), not Equipment-specific — the same call Bound by Moonsilver makes. The
 * Aura stays under its controller's control while enchanting an opponent's creature, so only that
 * controller ever sees the activation. Unlike an Aura moved by "attach" during the enchant-target
 * check, the new host must merely be a creature; the printed ability names no further restriction.
