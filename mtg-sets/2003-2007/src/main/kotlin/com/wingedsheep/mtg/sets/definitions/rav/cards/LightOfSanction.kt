/**
 * Light of Sanction
 * {1}{W}{W}
 * Enchantment
 *
 * Prevent all damage that would be dealt to creatures you control by sources you control.
 *
 * One [PreventDamage] replacement with both halves of the sentence filled in: recipients are
 * [Recipient.CreatureYouControl] and sources are `GameObjectFilter.Any.youControl()`. Both "you"s are
 * the enchantment's *current* controller, re-read per damage instance, so creatures that come under
 * your control later are covered and creatures that leave it stop being.
 *
 * `GameObjectFilter.Any.youControl()` deliberately covers more than permanents — a burn spell on the stack and
 * an activated ability's source are checked by controller the same way — which is what makes this
 * the "point my own sweepers at my own board" card it was printed to be. Players are not creatures,
 * so it never protects you.
