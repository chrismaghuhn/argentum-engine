/**
 * Woebringer Demon
 * {3}{B}{B}
 * Creature — Demon
 * 4/4
 *
 * Flying
 * At the beginning of each player's upkeep, that player sacrifices a creature of their choice.
 * If the player can't, sacrifice this creature.
 *
 * "If the player can't" is read off the sacrifice that just happened, not off a board scan:
 * [DynamicAmount.PermanentsSacrificedThisWay] counts what the edict earlier in this same
 * composite actually took, so the fallback fires exactly when nothing was sacrificed. A board
 * count would have to re-derive the same answer a step later, after the creature is already
 * gone.
 *
 * On its own controller's upkeep the Demon is itself a legal sacrifice, so the edict always has
 * something to take and the self-sacrifice clause only bites on an opponent's empty board.
