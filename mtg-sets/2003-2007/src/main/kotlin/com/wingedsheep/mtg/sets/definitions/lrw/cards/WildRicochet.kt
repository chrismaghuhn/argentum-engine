/**
 * Wild Ricochet
 * {2}{R}{R}
 * Instant
 *
 * You may choose new targets for target instant or sorcery spell. Then copy that spell. You may
 * choose new targets for the copy.
 *
 * Three clauses, and the middle one is the reason the first can't be [Effects.ChangeTarget]: that
 * effect swaps a *single* target and silently no-ops on a spell with more than one, so a Fireball
 * split among three creatures would keep every original target. The all-targets retarget is
 * `ChangeTriggeringObjectTargets`, which until this card only ever read
 * `context.triggeringEntityId` — hence the `spell` parameter, pointing it at the spell this card
 * targeted instead. The chooser may change all, some or none of them (the 2013-07-01 ruling), which
 * is what that effect already does per slot.
 *
 * Order matters: the retarget resolves first, so the copy is made from the spell *as retargeted* and
 * inherits the new targets before the second "you may choose new targets" is offered.
 * [Effects.CopyTargetSpell] carries that second prompt itself, so the third clause needs no effect
 * of its own — and it is the copy's own prompt, so declining it leaves the copy pointed wherever the
 * first retarget left the original.
 *
 * The target is any instant or sorcery spell, not one you control: "it doesn't matter who controls
 * it", and the copy is controlled by you either way.
