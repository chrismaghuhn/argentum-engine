/**
 * Excruciator
 * {6}{R}{R}
 * Creature — Avatar
 * 7/7
 *
 * Damage that would be dealt by this creature can't be prevented.
 *
 * The same [DamageCantBePrevented] replacement as Leyline of Punishment, *scoped to its own
 * source*: `EventPattern.DamageEvent(source = GameObjectFilter.Any.sourceItself())` is the "by this creature" half,
 * so every other source's damage on the battlefield stays preventable. Protection prevents damage
 * (CR 702.16e), which is why Excruciator can damage a creature with protection from red — while
 * still being unable to *block* one, since protection's other three letters are untouched.
 *
 * Only effects that use the word "prevent" are switched off: redirection still applies, shield
 * counters and prevention shields survive un-consumed, regeneration still works, and a replacement
 * that swaps the damage for something else (Phytohydra) still replaces it.
