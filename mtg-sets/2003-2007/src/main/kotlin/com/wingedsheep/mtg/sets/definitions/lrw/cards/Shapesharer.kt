/**
 * Shapesharer — Lorwyn #85
 * {1}{U} · Creature — Shapeshifter · 1/1
 *
 * Changeling (This card is every creature type.)
 * {2}{U}: Target Shapeshifter becomes a copy of target creature until your next turn.
 *
 * Two target requirements in printed order: the Shapeshifter that changes (index 0) and the
 * creature it copies (index 1). [Effects.EachPermanentBecomesCopyOfTarget] carries both — the
 * `affected` parameter names the permanent that becomes the copy, `target` the copy source —
 * which is Fleeting Reflection's shape with a longer duration.
 *
 * **"Target Shapeshifter" is a bare tribal noun, so it reads *permanent*, not creature.** Lorwyn
 * prints no noncreature Shapeshifter permanent, but the reading is the one the rules give and the
 * one the corpus standardised on; a `Creature.withSubtype` spelling would silently narrow it the
 * day a Kindred artifact with changeling shows up. Changeling itself makes every changeling card a
 * Shapeshifter, so the ability can retarget any of them.
 *
 * [Duration.UntilYourNextTurn] is the printed "until your next turn" exactly: the copy is reverted
 * after the untap step of this ability's controller's next turn, which is the ruling's "doesn't
 * wear off until just before your next untap step (even if an effect will cause that untap step to
 * be skipped)".
 *
 * The rest of the rulings are Rule 707 falling out of the shared copy machinery rather than
 * anything this card spells: copiable values only (so counters, tapped state, attachments and
 * pump effects on the source are not copied, and effects already applied to the *affected*
 * Shapeshifter keep applying on top), copies-of-copies resolve to what the source is copying, and
 * a Shapesharer that copies something else loses changeling and this very ability along with the
 * rest of its printed card. Either target becoming illegal makes the whole ability do nothing.
