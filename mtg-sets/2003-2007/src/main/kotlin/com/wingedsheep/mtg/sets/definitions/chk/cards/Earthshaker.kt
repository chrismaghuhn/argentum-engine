/**
 * Earthshaker
 * {4}{R}{R}
 * Creature — Spirit
 * 4/5
 * Whenever you cast a Spirit or Arcane spell, this creature deals 2 damage to each creature without flying.
 *
 * The Kamigawa "Whenever you cast a Spirit or Arcane spell" trigger is a `SpellCastEvent` watching
 * *your* casts with an OR over the two subtypes. `withAnySubtype` builds the single
 * `CardPredicate.Or` the grammar expects, in one call — the `or` infix collapses to the same
 * predicate here, but only because both branches are homogeneous, so the direct spelling is the
 * one all thirteen CHK cards in this family share. `Triggers.you.casts(spell, requires)` supplies `Player.You`
 * and `TriggerBinding.ANY`, so Earthshaker also triggers off its own cast.
 *
 * The payoff is a group sweep, not a targeted burn: `ForEachInGroup` over every creature lacking
 * flying, with `EffectTarget.IterationEntity` inside the body resolving to the current iteration entity.
 * Earthshaker has no flying itself, so it is in its own blast radius (and survives it at 4/5).
