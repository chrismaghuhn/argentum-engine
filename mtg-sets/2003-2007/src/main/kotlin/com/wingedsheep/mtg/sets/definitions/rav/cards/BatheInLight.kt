/**
 * Bathe in Light
 * {1}{W}
 * Instant
 *
 * Radiance — Choose a color. Target creature and each other creature that shares a color with it
 * gain protection from the chosen color until end of turn.
 *
 * Two independent ideas that only look entangled. The **colour choice** is
 * [Effects.ChooseColorThen], which pauses for the decision and re-runs its body with the chosen
 * colour on the effect context — every `GrantProtectionFromChosenColor` under it reads that one
 * colour, so the whole radiance group is protected from the same colour (Scryfall ruling: the
 * chosen colour has nothing to do with the colour the creatures share). The **radiance group** is
 * the usual RAV shape: the target is granted directly, and every *other* creature sharing a colour
 * with it (`sharingColorWith(EffectTarget.ContextTarget(0))`, `otherThanTarget()`) is gathered once at
 * resolution and granted via [Effects.ForEachInGroup] with `EffectTarget.IterationEntity` bound to each
 * iterated creature — the documented `ChooseColorThen` + `ForEachInGroup` recipe.
 *
 * A colorless target shares a colour with nothing, not even other colorless creatures, so only it
 * is protected; and because only one creature is targeted, an illegal target fizzles the whole
 * spell and no other creature is affected.
