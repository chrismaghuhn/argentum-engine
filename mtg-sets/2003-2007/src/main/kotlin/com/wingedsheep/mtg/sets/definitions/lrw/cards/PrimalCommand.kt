/**
 * Primal Command
 * {3}{G}{G}
 * Sorcery
 * Choose two —
 * • Target player gains 7 life.
 * • Put target noncreature permanent on top of its owner's library.
 * • Target player shuffles their graveyard into their library.
 * • Search your library for a creature card, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle.
 *
 * The green member of the Lorwyn Command cycle. Three of the four modes target; the search mode
 * doesn't, and its "reveal it" is the `reveal = true` flag on the standard
 * [Patterns.Library.searchLibrary] recipe rather than a separate reveal step.
 *
 * The 2017-03-14 rulings both fall out of the sequential mode resolution that
 * [AustereCommand] documents — the graveyard shuffle happens after the tuck, so a permanent put on
 * top of a library is shuffled away by a later mode, and Primal Command itself is still on the
 * stack (not yet in a graveyard) when its own shuffle mode runs.
