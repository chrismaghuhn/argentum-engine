/**
 * Savra, Queen of the Golgari
 * {2}{B}{G}
 * Legendary Creature — Elf Shaman
 * 2/2
 * Whenever you sacrifice a black creature, you may pay 2 life. If you do, each other player
 * sacrifices a creature of their choice.
 * Whenever you sacrifice a green creature, you may gain 2 life.
 *
 * Both triggers use the bare-article `Triggers.you.sacrifices(filter)` template, which fires once per
 * matching creature sacrificed and counts Savra sacrificing *herself* — she is both black and
 * green, so sacrificing Savra triggers both abilities (her own ruling), and a black-green
 * creature likewise triggers both.
 *
 * "You may pay 2 life. If you do, …" is the [Gate.MayPay] pay-then-payoff over [PayLifeEffect],
 * the shape [com.wingedsheep.mtg.sets.definitions.fin.cards.SeymourFlux] uses; the plain "you may
 * gain 2 life" is the builder's `optional = true`. "Each other player" renders as
 * [Player.EachOpponent], this corpus's standing spelling for it (Syphon Soul), and the sacrificing
 * player picks their own creature — `ForceSacrificeEffect` names who sacrifices, not what.
