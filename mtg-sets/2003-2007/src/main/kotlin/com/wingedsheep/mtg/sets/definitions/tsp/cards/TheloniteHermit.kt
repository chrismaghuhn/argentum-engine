/**
 * Thelonite Hermit
 * {3}{G}
 * Creature — Elf Shaman
 * 1 / 1
 * All Saprolings get +1/+1.
 * Morph {3}{G}{G} (You may cast this card face down as a 2/2 creature for {3}. Turn it face up any time for its morph cost.)
 * When this creature is turned face up, create four 1/1 green Saproling creature tokens.
 *
 * The lord is "all Saprolings", not "Saprolings you control" — the group filter carries no
 * controller predicate, and it is permanent-position rather than creature-position so a
 * non-creature Saproling would still be pumped.
