/**
 * Kami of Fire's Roar
 * {3}{R}
 * Creature — Spirit
 * 2/3
 * Whenever you cast a Spirit or Arcane spell, target creature can't block this turn.
 *
 * The Kamigawa "Whenever you cast a Spirit or Arcane spell" trigger is a `SpellCastEvent` watching
 * *your* casts with an OR over the two subtypes — `withAnySubtype` builds the single
 * `CardPredicate.Or` the grammar expects, rather than the `anyOf` branch list that the `or` infix
 * on `GameObjectFilter` would produce. `Triggers.you.casts(spell, requires)` supplies `Player.You` and
 * `TriggerBinding.ANY`, so Kami of Fire's Roar also triggers off its own cast.
 *
 * "Can't block this turn" is `Effects.CantBlock`, whose default `Duration.EndOfTurn` already says
 * "this turn"; it is a combat-legality rider on the target, not a projection change.
