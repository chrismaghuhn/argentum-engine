 * Argentum Assay declines this one — its grammar has no rule for the noun phrase "an Arcane card" —
 * so it is authored straight from the printed text. The printed "you may" is the builder's
 * `optional = true` (which lowers to a `Gate.MayDecide` around the return), and the target is the
 * bare-noun-subtype graveyard spelling `CardInGraveyard.withSubtype(ARCANE).ownedByYou()`. A target
 * is still chosen when the trigger goes on the stack — the yes/no comes at resolution.
