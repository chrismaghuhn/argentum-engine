 * Both clauses read the same target, so the life gain is an
 * [DynamicAmount.EntityProperty] on [EffectTarget.ContextTarget] rather than a fixed number — it is
 * measured on resolution, after the regeneration shield goes up, so a pumped or shrunken creature
 * pays out its current toughness. There is no `Effects.Regenerate` facade; [RegenerateEffect] is
 * the shipped spelling (see Reknit).
