/**
 * Ore Gorger
 * {3}{R}{R}
 * Creature — Spirit
 * 3/1
 * Whenever you cast a Spirit or Arcane spell, you may destroy target nonbasic land.
 *
 * The red half of the CHK "Whenever you cast a Spirit or Arcane spell" cycle: the shared
 * `Triggers.you.casts(spell, requires)` over a homogeneous OR of the two subtype filters, binding `ANY`.
 *
 * The printed "you may" is the builder's `optional = true`, which lowers to a `Gate.MayDecide`
 * around the destroy — the model has no separate optional flag. The target is still chosen when
 * the trigger goes on the stack (a "you may" gates the *action*, not the targeting, CR 603.3d),
 * so an ability with no legal nonbasic land in play never goes on the stack at all.
 *
 * [TargetFilter.NonbasicLand] is `IsLand` plus `Not(IsBasicLand)` — a supertype test, so a
 * nonbasic land printed with a basic land type (a Kamigawa legendary land, a shockland) is a
 * legal target while a real basic never is.
