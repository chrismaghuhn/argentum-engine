/**
 * Galepowder Mage
 * {3}{W}
 * Creature — Kithkin Wizard
 * 3/3
 *
 * Flying
 * Whenever this creature attacks, exile another target creature. Return that card to the
 * battlefield under its owner's control at the beginning of the next end step.
 *
 * The exile-and-return-later blink, built as Kykar builds it: an [Effects.Exile] followed by a
 * [CreateDelayedTriggerEffect] on [Step.END] that moves the exiled card back. The delayed
 * trigger is what makes this a *blink* rather than removal — the card leaves and comes back as
 * a new object, so Auras fall off, counters are gone, and enters-the-battlefield triggers fire
 * again.
 *
 * Two details the text carries and the script honors: "another" excludes Galepowder Mage itself
 * ([TargetFilter.OtherCreature]), and the target is any creature, not just yours — the classic
 * use is exiling your own enters-trigger creature, but pointing it at an opposing blocker to
 * remove it from combat is equally legal. "Under its owner's control" is [Zone.BATTLEFIELD]'s
 * default for a returning card, so a creature you stole and then blinked goes home.
