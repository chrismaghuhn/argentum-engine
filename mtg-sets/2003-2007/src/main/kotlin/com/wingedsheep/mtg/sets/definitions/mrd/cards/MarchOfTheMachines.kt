/**
 * March of the Machines — Mirrodin #42
 * {3}{U} · Enchantment
 *
 * Each noncreature artifact is an artifact creature with power and toughness each equal to its
 * mana value. (Equipment that's a creature can't equip a creature.)
 *
 * Titania's Song (ATQ) minus the ability wipe and minus the leaves-the-battlefield linger, so it
 * is two continuous group statics over noncreature artifacts (CR 613):
 *  - Layer 4 (TYPE): [GrantCardType] "CREATURE" — they are already artifacts, so this alone makes
 *    them artifact creatures, and any other card types (an artifact land, an artifact enchantment)
 *    are kept.
 *  - Layer 7b (POWER_TOUGHNESS, SET_VALUES): [SetBasePowerToughnessDynamicStatic] fed each
 *    permanent's own mana value ([EffectTarget.AffectedEntity] → [EntityNumericProperty.ManaValue]).
 *
 * The `Artifact.notCreature()` filter is locked in at effect-collection time — it is not an
 * IsCreature-keyed filter the projector re-resolves after Layer 4 — so the same set is animated in
 * Layer 4 and re-sized in Layer 7b (the Opalescence/Conspiracy locked-set rule).
 *
 * Three printed consequences fall out of the layers rather than needing card-specific wiring:
 * artifact lands have mana value 0 and so die as 0/0s to state-based actions; a later animation
 * effect (Chimeric Staff) applies in the same layer with a later timestamp and wins; and an
 * Equipment that becomes a creature is unattached by the CR 301.5c state-based action, which is
 * exactly what the reminder text describes.
