/**
 * Colfenor's Urn
 * {3} Artifact
 *
 * Whenever a creature with toughness 4 or greater is put into your graveyard from the
 * battlefield, you may exile it.
 * At the beginning of the end step, if three or more cards have been exiled with this
 * artifact, sacrifice it. If you do, return those cards to the battlefield under their
 * owner's control.
 *
 * Both halves are the linked-exile pile: the first ability feeds it, the second empties it.
 *
 * - **"into *your* graveyard"** is an ownership clause, not a control one — a creature you own
 *   that an opponent has stolen still dies into your graveyard — so the filter is
 *   `ownedByYou()`, never `youControl()`.
 * - **Toughness is read from last-known information.** The creature is already in the graveyard
 *   when the trigger is checked; `TriggerMatcher` threads `lastKnownToughness` off the
 *   `ZoneChangeEvent` for battlefield departures, so `toughnessAtLeast(4)` measures the creature
 *   as it last existed on the battlefield (a 4-toughness creature killed by -4/-4 does not
 *   trigger; one pumped to 4 does).
 * - **A token triggers but can't be exiled** (2007-10-01 ruling): it ceases to exist as a state
 *   based action before the trigger resolves, so the move finds nothing. That falls out of the
 *   engine's own zone handling — no special case here.
 * - **The end-step ability is a mandatory sacrifice with an intervening "if"** (CR 603.4), so it
 *   only triggers at three or more cards and re-checks on resolution. `IfYouDo` gates the return
 *   on the sacrifice actually happening: the 2007-10-01 ruling is explicit that an Urn which left
 *   the battlefield or changed controllers returns nothing. `SuccessCriterion.PermanentsSacrificed`
 *   is what makes that fail-closed — the same shape as Safe Haven's upkeep ability.
 * - The count is over the **whole game**, not the turn: `LINKED_EXILE_CARD_COUNT` reads the pile
 *   itself, which is exactly that.
