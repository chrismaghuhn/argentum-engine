/**
 * Harpoon Sniper
 * {2}{W}
 * Creature — Merfolk Archer
 * 2/2
 * {W}, {T}: This creature deals X damage to target attacking or blocking creature, where X is the
 * number of Merfolk you control.
 *
 * "Attacking or blocking creature" is one printed noun phrase and one shipped filter,
 * [TargetFilter.AttackingOrBlockingCreature] — not an or of two clauses.
 *
 * X counts Merfolk *permanents* you control, so the filter is [GameObjectFilter.Permanent] rather
 * than `.Creature`: Lorwyn's Kindred noncreature permanents carry creature types, and a Kindred
 * Enchantment — Merfolk you control is a Merfolk. Note the scope has to be
 * `battlefield(Player.You, …)` and not `DynamicAmounts.creaturesWithSubtype`, which is
 * [Player.Each] and would count an opponent's Merfolk too. The count is read on resolution, so
 * the Sniper itself is included and a Merfolk that died in response is not.
