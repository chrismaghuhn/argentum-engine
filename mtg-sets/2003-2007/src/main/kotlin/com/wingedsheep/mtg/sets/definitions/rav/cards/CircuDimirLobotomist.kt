/**
 * Circu, Dimir Lobotomist — Ravnica: City of Guilds #196
 * {2}{U}{B} · Legendary Creature — Human Wizard · Rare · 2/3
 *
 * Whenever you cast a blue spell, exile the top card of target player's library.
 * Whenever you cast a black spell, exile the top card of target player's library.
 * Your opponents can't cast spells with the same name as a card exiled with Circu.
 *
 * Modelling notes:
 * - **Two separate triggered abilities, not one with an "or" filter.** A blue *and* black spell
 *   fires both (the 2005-10-01 ruling), and each picks its own target — a filter reading
 *   "blue or black" would fire once and exile one card. Writing them as two abilities is what
 *   makes "you can target two different players or target the same player twice" fall out.
 * - The exile is a **linked** one (CR 607): `linkToSource = true` files each card against this
 *   permanent so the static below can read the whole pile. That is also why a replacement Circu
 *   does not inherit the old one's exiles.
 * - The prohibition is the reused [PlayersCantCastSpells] static scoped to `EachOpponent` — the
 *   card is not symmetric, per its own ruling that the last ability applies to all of its
 *   controller's opponents rather than to the owner of the exiled card.
 * - **New SDK vocabulary:** `CardPredicate.SharesNameWithLinkedExile`, reached here through
 *   `GameObjectFilter.Any.sharingNameWithLinkedExile()`. It is the *name* axis of the existing
 *   `SharesCardTypeWithLinkedExile` (Cemetery Illuminator) and, like it, has to be pile-wide:
 *   `sharingNameWith(EffectTarget.LinkedExiledCard())` reads exactly one index, and Circu's
 *   pile grows on every blue and every black spell you cast, so no index names "a card exiled
 *   with Circu". Comparing printed names is correct on both sides — neither an exiled card nor a
 *   card in a hand or library has a battlefield projection a Layer-3 rename could have touched.
 * - Split cards: the ruling says exiling one half locks out both. Our `CardComponent.name` for a
 *   split card is the full "A // B" string, so a split card exiled this way blocks casting either
 *   half only insofar as the halves share that name — an approximation the corpus can't currently
 *   improve on, and one no RAV-era card exercises (no split cards are legal alongside it in
 *   Standard-era play).
