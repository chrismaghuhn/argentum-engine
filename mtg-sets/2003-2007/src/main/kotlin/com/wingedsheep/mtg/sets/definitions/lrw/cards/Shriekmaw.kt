 * Shriekmaw

 * Creature — Elemental
 * 3/2
 * Fear
 * When this creature enters, destroy target nonartifact, nonblack creature.
 * Evoke {1}{B}
 *
 * Same shape as Mulldrifter: `evoke = "{1}{B}"` is the alternative cost and the engine adds the
 * "sacrifice it when it enters" trigger itself. The destroy trigger is a plain enters trigger with a
 * nonartifact-nonblack target; when evoked, both triggers go on the stack together and the
 * controller orders them (the 2021-03-19 ruling).
