/**
 * Mirror Entity
 * {2}{W}
 * Creature — Shapeshifter
 * 1/1
 *
 * Changeling (This card is every creature type.)
 * {X}: Until end of turn, creatures you control have base power and toughness X/X and gain all
 * creature types.
 *
 * The group is gathered when the ability resolves, so creatures that arrive later in the turn
 * are unaffected — the ability doesn't keep applying to whatever you control at any moment.
 * Mirror Entity is in that group and sets its own base P/T too.
 *
 * "Base power and toughness X/X" is layer 7b (setting), so it *overwrites* earlier setting
 * effects but sits underneath +N/+N counters and pump spells, which apply in 7c/7d. Activating
 * for X=1 after a big X therefore shrinks your team; activating twice, the later activation
 * wins on timestamp. `SetBasePowerAndToughness` freezes [DynamicAmount.XValue] at resolution
 * rather than re-reading it, which is what a one-shot activation needs.
 *
 * "Gain all creature types" is Changeling granted for the turn (CR 702.73) — the same expansion
 * the printed keyword uses, so the pumped team is Elves and Goblins and Merfolk at once for
 * every tribal lord you control.
