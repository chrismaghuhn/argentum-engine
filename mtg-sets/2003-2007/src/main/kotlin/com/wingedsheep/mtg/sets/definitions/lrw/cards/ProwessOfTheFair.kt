/**
 * Prowess of the Fair
 * {1}{B}
 * Kindred Enchantment — Elf
 * Whenever another nontoken Elf is put into your graveyard from the battlefield, you may create a
 * 1/1 green Elf Warrior creature token.
 *
 * The filter is deliberately not creature-scoped: the bare tribal noun "Elf" names every permanent
 * with the subtype, and Lorwyn's Kindred cards carry creature types onto noncreature permanents —
 * Prowess of the Fair is itself an Elf, which is what the "another" is guarding against.
 * "Another" is [TriggerBinding.OTHER], not a filter predicate; "your graveyard" is ownership
 * rather than control, since a permanent always goes to its owner's graveyard (CR 400.3).
