/**
 * Dimir Doppelganger — Ravnica: City of Guilds #202 (canonical printing)
 * {1}{U}{B} · Creature — Shapeshifter · 0/2
 *
 * {1}{U}{B}: Exile target creature card from a graveyard. This creature becomes a copy of that
 * card, except it has this ability.
 *
 * The Likeness Looter shape with an exile step in front of it. `sourceFromAnyZone` is what makes the
 * ordering work: the copy reads the card's copiable characteristics (CR 707.2) after it has already
 * left the graveyard for exile, and the target handle still names the same entity on the other side
 * of that zone change.
 *
 * `retainActivatingAbility` is the "except it has this ability" clause, and it is the whole card
 * rather than a rider — the copy replaces the permanent's `CardComponent` wholesale, so without the
 * re-grant the Doppelganger could copy exactly once and then never again. The grant is durable and
 * keyed by entity, so it survives each subsequent copy; the 2005-10-01 ruling ("if it becomes a copy
 * of a different creature card, the new copy will overwrite the old copy") is that same property
 * read from the other side.
 *
 * Any graveyard is a legal source — the text says "a graveyard", not "your graveyard".
