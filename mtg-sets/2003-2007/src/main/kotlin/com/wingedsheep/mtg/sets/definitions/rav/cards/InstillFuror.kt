/**
 * Instill Furor — Ravnica: City of Guilds #134 (canonical printing, only printing)
 * {1}{R} · Enchantment — Aura
 *
 * Enchant creature
 * Enchanted creature has "At the beginning of your end step, sacrifice this creature unless it
 * attacked this turn."
 *
 * The printed text grants the ability rather than printing it on the Aura, and that distinction is
 * the whole card, so it is a [GrantTriggeredAbility] over [GroupFilter.attachedCreature] (the Relic
 * Bane shape) rather than a trigger on the Aura itself. Two rulings depend on it:
 *
 * - "Instill Furor grants a triggered ability that triggers at the end of the *creature's
 *   controller's* turn" (2005-10-01). The granted ability is controlled by whoever controls the
 *   creature, so `Triggers.you.beginningOf(Step.END)` reads that player's end step — not the Aura controller's.
 *   Stealing the creature moves the clock with it.
 * - "Once the ability triggers, nothing that happens to Instill Furor can prevent the ability from
 *   resolving" (2005-10-01). The ability is an independent object on the stack once it triggers;
 *   nothing here re-reads the Aura at resolution.
 *
 * "Sacrifice … **unless** it attacked this turn" is a resolution-time test, not an intervening "if"
 * (CR 603.4 vs 608.2), so it is a [Effects.If] inside the effect rather than an
 * `interveningIf` on the trigger: the ability always triggers and always goes on the stack, and the
 * attack check happens as it resolves. `Conditions.SourceAttackedThisTurn` reads the *granted*
 * ability's source, which is the enchanted creature, exactly as the printed "it" demands.
