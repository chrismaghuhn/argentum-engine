/**
 * Thousand-Year Elixir

 * You may activate abilities of creatures you control as though those creatures had haste.
 * {1}, {T}: Untap target creature.
 *
 * The static is deliberately *not* a haste grant (the 2007-10-01 ruling): it lifts only the
 * `{T}`/`{Q}` half of CR 302.6, never the attack half. Shang-Chi, Master of Kung Fu carries the
 * identical permission as [GrantKeyword]([AbilityFlag.MAY_ACTIVATE_ABILITIES_AS_THOUGH_HASTY],
 * creatures you control), which only `SummoningSicknessRules` reads.
