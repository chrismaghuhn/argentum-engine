/**
 * Brass Gnat
 * {1}
 * Artifact Creature — Insect
 * 1/1
 * Flying
 * This creature doesn't untap during your untap step.
 * At the beginning of your upkeep, you may pay {1}. If you do, untap this creature.
 *
 * The upkeep tax is the whole card: the wind-down is [AbilityFlag.DOESNT_UNTAP] (the engine's
 * untap-step skip, shared with Galvanic Juggernaut and Leviathan) and the winding is a
 * [Gate.MayPay] — "you may pay {1}. If you do" is one resolution, payment and payoff together,
 * not a reflexive trigger.
 *
 * Assay's `compile` model does not carry the "doesn't untap" line (it emits only the upkeep
 * trigger and Flying); `flags` sits outside the differential's compared surface, so the flag is
 * authored here to keep the card behaviourally right.
