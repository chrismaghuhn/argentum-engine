/**
 * Guile — Lorwyn #69
 *
 * The counter replacement is [ExileCounteredSpellInstead]: the spell is exiled instead of
 * countered (so it was never countered), and Guile's controller may cast it right away, without
 * paying its mana cost, before the countering spell or ability goes on resolving. Declining leaves
 * the card in exile for good. A spell that can't be countered isn't, so Guile never sees it.
