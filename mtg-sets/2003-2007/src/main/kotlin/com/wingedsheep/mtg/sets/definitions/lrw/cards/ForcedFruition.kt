/**
 * Forced Fruition

 * Enchantment
 * Whenever an opponent casts a spell, that player draws seven cards.
 *
 * The draw lands on the caster, not on Forced Fruition's controller, so the payoff is bound to
 * [Player.TriggeringPlayer]. The trigger fires on the cast itself — it resolves before the spell
 * does, and it still resolves if that spell is later countered.
