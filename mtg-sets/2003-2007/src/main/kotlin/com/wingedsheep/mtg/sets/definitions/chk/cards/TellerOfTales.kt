/**
 * Teller of Tales
 * {3}{U}{U}
 * Creature — Spirit
 * 3/3
 * Flying
 * Whenever you cast a Spirit or Arcane spell, you may tap or untap target creature.
 *
 * The shared CHK "Whenever you cast a Spirit or Arcane spell" trigger — `Triggers.you.casts(spell, requires)`
 * over a homogeneous OR of the two subtype filters, binding `ANY`.
 *
 * "You may tap or untap target creature" is the corpus' Granite Witness idiom: the printed
 * "you may" is the builder's `optional = true` (lowering to a `Gate.MayDecide`), and the
 * tap-or-untap half is a two-[Mode] [ModalEffect] over the single declared target with
 * `countsAsModalSpell = false` — CR 700.2 modality is a property of a *spell*, and this choice is
 * made on resolution. The SDK deliberately has no "tap or untap" effect: [TapUntapEffect] carries
 * the direction as a boolean, so the choice between two fixed directions is what a modal already
 * spells.
 *
 * The target is locked in when the trigger goes on the stack while the direction is not, so an
 * opponent who taps the creature in response doesn't strand you on the useless half.
