/**
 * Vigor Mortis — Ravnica: City of Guilds #111
 * {2}{B}{B} · Sorcery
 *
 * Return target creature card from your graveyard to the battlefield. If {G} was spent to cast this
 * spell, that creature enters with an additional +1/+1 counter on it.
 *
 * The rider is spelled "enters **with**", not "then put a counter on it", so the counter has to ride
 * along with the move rather than follow it — that is `Effects.Move`'s `addCounterType`, the same
 * spelling Thunderbolts Conspiracy uses for "return it to the battlefield with a finality counter on
 * it". The counter lands inside the move executor, before the enters-the-battlefield triggers it
 * caused are put on the stack, so a trigger that reads the creature's counters or its power sees the
 * counter — the distinction Miraculous Recovery's rulings draw for the *other* wording.
 *
 * The gate therefore has to sit around the whole move (two branches of the same reanimation), not
 * after it: there is no point in the resolution at which the creature is on the battlefield and the
 * counter is still pending.
