/**
 * Vindictive Mob
 * {4}{B}{B}
 * Creature — Human Berserker
 * 5/5
 * When this creature enters, sacrifice a creature.
 * This creature can't be blocked by Saprolings.
 *
 * The bare imperative "sacrifice a creature" is [Effects.SacrificeOwn] — the ability's controller
 * sacrifices, with no player named. `Effects.Sacrifice` is the other sentence ("target opponent
 * sacrifices ..."). The Mob itself is a legal choice, which is what makes it a real drawback when
 * it is the only creature you control.
 *
 * The blocker noun is the bare tribal "Saprolings", i.e. Saproling *permanents* —
 * [GameObjectFilter.Permanent] with the subtype, not `.Creature`.
