/**
 * Seedguide Ash
 * {4}{G}
 * Creature — Treefolk Druid
 * 4/4
 * When this creature dies, you may search your library for up to three Forest cards, put them
 * onto the battlefield tapped, then shuffle.
 *
 * "Forest cards" — not *basic* Forest cards — so the filter is any land with the Forest subtype;
 * a dual such as Stomping Ground qualifies. The whole-trigger "you may" is `optional = true`
 * rather than a wrapped `Effects.May`, and `SelectionMode.ChooseUpTo` is what `searchLibrary`'s
 * `count` already means, so "up to three" needs nothing extra.
