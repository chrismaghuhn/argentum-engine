/**
 * Tarmogoyf
 * {1}{G}
 * Creature — Lhurgoyf
 * Power/toughness: star / 1+star
 *
 * Tarmogoyf's power is equal to the number of card types among cards in all graveyards and its
 * toughness is equal to that number plus 1.
 *
 * A characteristic-defining ability (the Lhurgoyf shape): one [DynamicAmount] feeds both base power
 * and base toughness via `dynamicStats`, with the "plus 1" as `toughnessOffset`. The count is
 * [DynamicAmount.AggregateZone] over [Player.Each]'s graveyards with [Aggregation.DISTINCT_TYPES] —
 * the aggregate flattens every player's graveyard into one list *before* taking distinct types, so
 * an artifact in each of two graveyards counts once ("counts card types, not cards").
