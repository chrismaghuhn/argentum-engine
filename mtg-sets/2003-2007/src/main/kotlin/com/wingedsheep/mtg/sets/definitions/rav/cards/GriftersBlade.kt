/**
 * Grifter's Blade
 * {3}
 * Artifact — Equipment
 * Flash
 * As this Equipment enters, choose a creature you control it could be attached to. If you do, it
 * enters attached to that creature.
 * Equipped creature gets +1/+1.
 * Equip {1}
 *
 * The entry clause is two existing replacements standing in a row rather than a new "enters
 * attached" primitive: [EntersWithChoice] with [ChoiceType.CREATURE_ON_BATTLEFIELD] records the
 * host on the Blade before it enters (its candidate pool is already "creature you control,
 * excluding the entering object", and an empty pool skips the choice — which is precisely the
 * card's "If you do" and its second ruling), and [OnEnterRun] then attaches to
 * [EffectTarget.ChosenCreature] inline with entry.
 *
 * "A creature you control **it could be attached to**" is, for an Equipment with no printed equip
 * restriction, every creature you control; the pool is exact today. A future Equipment that
 * *does* restrict its host would need the choice pool to take a filter.
 *
 * Not a "when this Equipment enters" trigger: a trigger uses the stack, so the Blade would sit
 * unattached while opponents responded and the attach could be answered — the card enters already
 * attached, with nothing to respond to.
