/**
 * Seshiro the Anointed
 * {4}{G}{G}
 * Legendary Creature — Snake Monk
 * 3/4
 *
 * Other Snake creatures you control get +2/+2.
 * Whenever a Snake you control deals combat damage to a player, you may draw a card.
 *
 * Two different Snake filters, because the two lines print two different nouns. The lord says
 * "Snake **creatures**", so it is [GameObjectFilter.Creature]`.withSubtype(SNAKE).youControl()` with
 * `excludeSelf` for the printed "Other"; the trigger says a bare "a Snake you control", which is any
 * *permanent* with the subtype, so that one is [GameObjectFilter.Permanent].
 *
 * The trigger is a [GrantTriggeredAbility]: each of your Snakes carries its own copy of "whenever
 * *this* deals combat damage to a player", so the granted ability keeps the default SELF binding and
 * the source of the damage is the Snake that bears it. The printed "you may" is an explicit
 * [Gate.MayDecide] around the draw.
