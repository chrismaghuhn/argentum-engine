/**
 * Wojek Apothecary
 * {2}{W}{W}
 * Creature — Human Cleric
 * 1/1
 *
 * Radiance — {T}: Prevent the next 1 damage that would be dealt to target creature and each other
 * creature that shares a color with it this turn.
 *
 * Radiance with a prevention shield instead of damage: the target gets its own shield directly,
 * and every *other* creature sharing a color with it (`sharingColorWith(EffectTarget.ContextTarget(0))`,
 * `otherThanTarget()`) is found as the ability resolves and gets a shield of its own. Each shield
 * is per-creature — 1 damage prevented on each, not 1 across the group — which is why this is a
 * `ForEachInGroup` around `PreventNextDamage` rather than a group-scoped prevention. A colorless
 * target shares a color with nothing, so only it is shielded.
 *
 * Scryfall lists a `psal` (Salvat 2005) printing three weeks before Ravnica, but that is a regional
 * box product rather than a real expansion, so the canonical printing stays RAV — the same call
 * Selesnya Sanctuary and Seed Spark document.
