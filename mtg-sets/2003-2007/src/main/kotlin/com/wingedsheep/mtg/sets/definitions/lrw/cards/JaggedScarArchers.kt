/**
 * Jagged-Scar Archers
 * {1}{G}{G}
 * Creature — Elf Archer
 * Printed power and toughness are both star (a characteristic-defining ability).
 * Jagged-Scar Archers's power and toughness are each equal to the number of Elves you control.
 * {T}: This creature deals damage equal to its power to target creature with flying.
 *
 * The bare noun "Elves" counts every Elf *permanent* you control, not only the creatures — and
 * the Archers is itself an Elf, so it counts itself.
 *
 * The damage amount reads the Archers' power off the *source* at resolution, so it sees the CDA
 * (and anything else in the layer stack) rather than a snapshot taken on activation. Tapping is
 * the whole cost, so the Archers is already tapped when the ability resolves — that doesn't change
 * its power. `damageSource` names the Archers so protection, prevention and "damage dealt by"
 * triggers attribute it correctly.
