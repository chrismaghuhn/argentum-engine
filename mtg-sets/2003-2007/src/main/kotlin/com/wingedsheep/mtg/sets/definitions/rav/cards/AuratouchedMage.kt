/**
 * Auratouched Mage
 * {5}{W}
 * Creature — Human Wizard
 * 3/3
 * When this creature enters, search your library for an Aura card that could enchant it. If this
 * creature is still on the battlefield, put that Aura card onto the battlefield attached to it.
 * Otherwise, reveal the Aura card and put it into your hand. Then shuffle.
 *
 * The search pool is `couldEnchant(Self)` — each Aura card's printed enchant restriction tested
 * against the Mage as it currently exists (so an Aura with "enchant artifact" qualifies if the
 * Mage has been made an artifact, per the ruling). Searching for a card with a stated quality may
 * fail to find (CR 701.23b), so the choice is up to one. The Aura then enters attached to the Mage
 * through `MoveCollectionEffect.attachTo` — the effect names the host, so there is no enchant
 * choice — or, with the Mage gone, goes to hand revealed.
