/**
 * Nath of the Gilt-Leaf
 * {3}{B}{G}
 * Legendary Creature — Elf Warrior
 * 4/4
 * At the beginning of your upkeep, you may have target opponent discard a card at random.
 * Whenever an opponent discards a card, you may create a 1/1 green Elf Warrior creature token.
 *
 * The upkeep trigger is a targeted optional trigger: `optional = true` on a trigger with a player
 * target — with a single opponent the target is auto-chosen and the "may" is asked when the trigger
 * resolves. The random discard is [Patterns.Hand.discardRandom] aimed at the chosen opponent —
 * Hypnotic Specter's shape.
 *
 * The token trigger is `Triggers.anOpponent.discards()`, which fires once per discarded card, so
 * an opponent discarding three cards offers three tokens. It fires off Nath's own upkeep discard
 * too, which is the card's point.
