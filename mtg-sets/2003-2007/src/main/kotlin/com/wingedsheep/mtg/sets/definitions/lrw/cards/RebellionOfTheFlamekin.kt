/**
 * Rebellion of the Flamekin
 * {3}{R}
 * Kindred Enchantment — Elemental
 * Whenever you clash, you may pay {1}. If you do, create a 3/1 red Elemental Shaman creature token.
 * If you won, that token gains haste until end of turn. (This ability triggers after the clash ends.)
 *
 * Three nested riders, each a different primitive:
 *
 *  - **"Whenever you clash"** — `Triggers.you.clashes()`, not the "and win" variant: the {1} is
 *    offered whether or not you won, and per its ruling it is offered on a clash an opponent's spell
 *    started too.
 *  - **"you may pay {1}. If you do, …"** — a [Gate.MayPay] over [PayManaCostEffect]; declining or
 *    being unable to pay makes the whole payoff, token and haste alike, not happen.
 *  - **"If you won, that token …"** — [Conditions.YouWonTheClash], the clash outcome carried on the
 *    trigger. It has to be read *after* the mana payment pauses and resumes, which is why the
 *    outcome lives on the resolving ability rather than in a pipeline collection.
 *
 * "That token" is [EffectTarget.PipelineTarget] over [CREATED_TOKENS], the slot
 * [Effects.CreateToken] publishes — so the haste lands on the token this resolution just made and
 * not on any other Elemental. It is a *granted* keyword for [Duration.EndOfTurn] rather than an
 * intrinsic one on the token, because the token outlives the turn and haste must not.
