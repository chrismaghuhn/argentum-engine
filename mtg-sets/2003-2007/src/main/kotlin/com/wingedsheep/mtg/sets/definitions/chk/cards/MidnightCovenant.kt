 *
 * "Enchant creature" is the builder's `auraTarget`. The granted ability rides
 * [GrantActivatedAbility], whose `filter` defaults to `GroupFilter.attachedCreature()` — exactly the
 * "enchanted creature" scope this card wants, so no filter is written. Inside the granted ability
 * [EffectTarget.Self] is the creature that activated it, which is what the quoted "this creature"
 * means once the ability has moved onto the enchanted permanent.
