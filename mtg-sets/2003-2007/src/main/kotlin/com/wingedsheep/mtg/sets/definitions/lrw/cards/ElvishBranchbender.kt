/**
 * Elvish Branchbender
 * {2}{G}
 * Creature — Elf Druid
 * 2/2
 *
 * {T}: Until end of turn, target Forest becomes an X/X Treefolk creature in addition to its other
 * types, where X is the number of Elves you control.
 *
 * X is locked in when the ability resolves (CR 613.4c) — the 2007-10-01 ruling says the animated
 * Forest keeps that size even if Elves die afterwards — so the count goes in `power`/`toughness`
 * rather than the continuously-re-evaluated `dynamicPower`/`dynamicToughness` pair.
 *
 * The bare noun "Elves" counts every Elf *permanent* you control, not only the creatures, and the
 * Branchbender is itself an Elf, so it counts itself.
 *
 * "In addition to its other types" is [Effects.BecomeCreature]'s default: it adds CREATURE and the
 * Treefolk subtype without removing LAND or the Forest subtype, so the animated land still taps
 * for {G}. Any Forest is a legal target, including an opponent's.
