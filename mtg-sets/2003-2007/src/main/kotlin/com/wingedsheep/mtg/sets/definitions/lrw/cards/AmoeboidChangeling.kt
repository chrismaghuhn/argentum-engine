/**
 * Amoeboid Changeling
 * {1}{U}
 * Creature — Shapeshifter
 * 1/1
 *
 * Changeling (This card is every creature type.)
 * {T}: Target creature gains all creature types until end of turn.
 * {T}: Target creature loses all creature types until end of turn.
 *
 * Both halves are Layer 4 type-changing effects; the engine's timestamp ordering decides which
 * wins when both are pointed at the same creature in one turn, which is exactly what the card
 * wants (the 2007-10-01 ruling: the later ability overwrites the earlier one).
 *
 * "Gains all creature types" is a grant of Changeling — the engine expands that keyword into every
 * creature type (CR 702.73). The losing half is the dedicated [Effects.LoseAllCreatureTypes], not
 * a keyword removal, because it must also strip printed subtypes.
