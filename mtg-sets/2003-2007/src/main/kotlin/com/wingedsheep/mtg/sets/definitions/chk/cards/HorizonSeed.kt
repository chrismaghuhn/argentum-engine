/**
 * Horizon Seed
 * {4}{W}
 * Creature — Spirit
 * 2/1
 * Whenever you cast a Spirit or Arcane spell, regenerate target creature.
 *
 * The Kamigawa "Whenever you cast a Spirit or Arcane spell" trigger is a `SpellCastEvent` watching
 * *your* casts with an OR over the two subtypes — `withAnySubtype` builds the single
 * `CardPredicate.Or` the grammar expects, rather than the `anyOf` branch list that the `or` infix
 * on `GameObjectFilter` would produce. `Triggers.you.casts(spell, requires)` supplies `Player.You` and
 * `TriggerBinding.ANY`, so Horizon Seed also triggers off its own cast.
 *
 * Regeneration has no `Effects.` facade — `RegenerateEffect` is the corpus spelling (Reknit,
 * Asceticism), and it lays down the one-shot destruction shield rather than acting immediately.
