/**
 * Hunted Phantasm — Ravnica: City of Guilds #55
 * {1}{U}{U} · Creature — Spirit · 4/6
 *
 * This creature can't be blocked.
 * When this creature enters, target opponent creates five 1/1 red Goblin creature tokens.
 *
 * The blue member of the Hunted cycle, and the one whose drawback is sharpest: the five Goblins can
 * never block the Phantasm itself, so they are pure offence for the defender. "Can't be blocked" is
 * the card-level [AbilityFlag.CANT_BE_BLOCKED] rather than a keyword (Tidal Kraken), and the Goblins
 * enter under the *targeted opponent's* control via [Effects.CreateToken]'s `controller`.
