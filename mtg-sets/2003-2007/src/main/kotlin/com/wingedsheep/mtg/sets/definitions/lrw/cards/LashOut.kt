/**
 * Lash Out
 * {1}{R}
 * Instant
 * Lash Out deals 3 damage to target creature. Clash with an opponent. If you win, Lash Out deals
 * 3 damage to that creature's controller.
 *
 * Two things worth stating, both of which the scenario test pins:
 *
 *  - **The clash happens whether or not the creature is still there.** The damage and the clash are
 *    separate sentences; only the creature *targeting* can fizzle the spell. Once it resolves, the
 *    clash runs — and per the Broken Ambitions ruling ("the clash happens regardless") that is the
 *    general shape of Lorwyn's clash spells.
 *  - **"That creature's controller" is [EffectTarget.TargetController], not a second target.** It
 *    resolves through the target's controller and falls back to last-known information when the
 *    3 damage already killed it (CR 608.2h), which is the common case: a 3-toughness creature dies
 *    to the first sentence and its controller still takes 3.
