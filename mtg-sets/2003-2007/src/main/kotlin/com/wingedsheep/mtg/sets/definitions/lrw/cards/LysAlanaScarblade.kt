/**
 * Lys Alana Scarblade
 * {2}{B}
 * Creature — Elf Assassin
 * 1/1
 * {T}, Discard an Elf card: Target creature gets -X/-X until end of turn, where X is the number of
 * Elves you control.
 *
 * X is an `AggregateBattlefield` tally read on resolution, not on activation — the 2016-06-08 ruling
 * is explicit that a Scarblade still on the battlefield counts itself, and that the count is taken
 * as the ability resolves. `Multiply(…, -1)` is how the SDK spells a shrink; the same amount serves
 * both halves because the card shrinks power and toughness equally.
 *
 * The two filters deliberately differ. The cost discards an Elf *card* from hand, so it is
 * `GameObjectFilter.Any` — that admits the Kindred noncreature Elf cards (Gilt-Leaf Ambush, Elvish
 * Promenade) alongside Elf creatures. The tally counts Elves on the battlefield, so it is
 * `GameObjectFilter.Permanent`.
