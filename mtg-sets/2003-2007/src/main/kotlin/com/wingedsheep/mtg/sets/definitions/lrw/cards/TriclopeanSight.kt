/**
 * Triclopean Sight
 * {1}{W}
 * Enchantment — Aura
 * Flash
 * Enchant creature
 * When this Aura enters, untap enchanted creature.
 * Enchanted creature gets +1/+1 and has vigilance.
 *
 * Flash plus the untap is the trick: cast it on a tapped attacker or blocker and it stands back up,
 * and the vigilance keeps it that way afterwards. The untap is a one-shot from the enters trigger,
 * so it fires once on arrival — [EffectTarget.EnchantedCreature] resolves through the Aura's own
 * attachment, which is already in place by the time the trigger resolves. The +1/+1 and the
 * vigilance are the continuous half and stay scoped to [Filters.EnchantedCreature].
