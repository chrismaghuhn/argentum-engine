/**
 * Call to the Netherworld
 * {B}
 * Sorcery
 * Return target black creature card from your graveyard to your hand.
 * Madness {0} (If you discard this card, discard it into exile. When you do, cast it for its
 * madness cost or put it into your graveyard.)
 *
 * Madness {0} is a real zero cost rather than the absence of one — `madness("{0}")` parses to a
 * payable cost, so the madness trigger still offers the free cast. `CardBuilder.build()` derives
 * the printed `Keyword.MADNESS` from the keyword ability, so the bare keyword is never written
 * beside it.
 *
 * The targeted return needs no `fromZone` guard: the requirement's own `zone = GRAVEYARD` is
 * re-checked at resolution under CR 608.2b, so [Effects.ReturnToHand] is the right facade here.
