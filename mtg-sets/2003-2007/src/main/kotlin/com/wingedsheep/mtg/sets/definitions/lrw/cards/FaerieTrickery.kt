 * Kindred Instant — Faerie
 * Counter target non-Faerie spell. If that spell is countered this way, exile it instead of
 * putting it into its owner's graveyard.
 *
 * "Non-Faerie" is a targeting restriction, so it is carried by the target filter rather than
 * checked at resolution: a Faerie spell is never a legal target in the first place. The subtype is
 * read off the spell on the stack, which means a changeling spell counts as a Faerie and can't be
 * hit — including Faerie Trickery's own Kindred Faerie siblings.
