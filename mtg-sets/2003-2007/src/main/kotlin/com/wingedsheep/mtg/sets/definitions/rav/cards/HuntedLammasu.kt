/**
 * Hunted Lammasu — Ravnica: City of Guilds #22
 * {2}{W}{W} · Creature — Lammasu · 5/5
 *
 * Flying
 * When this creature enters, target opponent creates a 4/4 black Horror creature token.
 *
 * The white member of the Hunted cycle: an over-statted body paid for by handing the defender a
 * blocker. The Horror enters under the *targeted opponent's* control, which is what
 * [Effects.CreateToken]'s `controller` parameter expresses — the trigger's controller creates
 * nothing (Hunted Bonebrute takes the same route). If the targeted opponent has become an illegal
 * target by resolution the whole trigger is removed from the stack and no Horror appears, leaving
 * the Lammasu's drawback unpaid.
