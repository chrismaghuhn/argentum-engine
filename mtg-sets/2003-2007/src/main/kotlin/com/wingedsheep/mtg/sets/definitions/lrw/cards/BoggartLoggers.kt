 * Boggart Loggers

 * Creature — Goblin Rogue
 * 2/1
 * Forestwalk
 * {2}{B}, Sacrifice this creature: Destroy target Treefolk or Forest.
 *
 * The printed target names two subtypes and no card type — a Treefolk is any permanent with that
 * creature type and a Forest is any land with that land type — so this is one
 * [GameObjectFilter.Permanent] with a [GameObjectFilter.withAnySubtype] union, not two clauses and not
 * a creature-typed filter. An animated Forest satisfies both halves; either is enough.
