/**
 * Suppression Field
 * {1}{W}
 * Enchantment
 *
 * Activated abilities cost {2} more to activate unless they're mana abilities.
 *
 * The board-wide form of Skyseer's Chariot's tax: the same [IncreaseActivatedAbilityCost], with
 * `GameObjectFilter.Any` in place of the chosen-name predicate so it reaches every source, its
 * controller's included. `excludeManaAbilities` is the "unless they're mana abilities" half — the
 * engine reads the ability's own `isManaAbility` flag (CR 605.1a), so a land's `{T}: Add …` and a
 * Signet's `{1}, {T}: Add …` stay at their printed cost while everything else pays {2} more.
 *
 * A tax, unlike a reduction, applies even to an ability with no mana in its cost: an equip, a
 * loyalty ability, or a bare `{T}:` becomes `{2}, {T}:`. Static and triggered abilities are
 * untouched — only abilities written "[cost]: [effect]" are activated abilities at all.
