/**
 * Molten Sentry
 * {3}{R}
 * Creature — Elemental
 * &#42;/&#42;
 * As this creature enters, flip a coin. If the coin comes up heads, this creature enters as a 5/2
 * creature with haste. If it comes up tails, this creature enters as a 2/5 creature with defender.
 *
 * There is no "enters as an X/Y with keyword" entry replacement, and there shouldn't be: a coin
 * flip is not a *choice*, so [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.EntersWithChoice] is the wrong shape,
 * and the two outcomes are just a base-P/T set plus a keyword grant that already exist. So the
 * card is [OnEnterRun] wrapping a [FlipCoinEffect] whose two branches each compose
 * `SetBasePowerAndToughness` + `GrantKeyword` at [Duration.Permanent] — nothing here expires, and
 * neither branch is undone if the Sentry later stops being the thing it entered as.
 *
 * The printed P/T is `*`/`*`: without the entry replacement the Sentry has no defined size, which
 * is 0/0. It never reaches state-based actions at that size, because `OnEnterRun` runs
 * inline with the entry — after placement, before SBAs — exactly as Frankenstein's Monster relies
 * on to survive as an 0/1 until its counters land.
 *
 * **Known divergence, shared with Frankenstein's Monster and Nameless Race.** "As this creature
 * enters" is a true entry replacement, but `OnEnterRun` runs just *after* the permanent is
 * on the battlefield. The permanent is momentarily a 0/0 Elemental with no keywords, so an ETB
 * trigger elsewhere that reads its power sees 0 rather than 5 or 2. Closing that needs a
 * pre-entry replacement hook, which is engine work rather than card work.
