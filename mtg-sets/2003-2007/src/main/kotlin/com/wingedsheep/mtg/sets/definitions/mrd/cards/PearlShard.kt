/**
 * Pearl Shard — Mirrodin #225 (canonical printing)
 * {3} · Artifact
 *
 * {3}, {T} or {W}, {T}: Prevent the next 2 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn.
 *
 * The white member of the Mirrodin Shard cycle, and modelled exactly like [GraniteShard]: the printed
 * "{3}, {T} or {W}, {T}" is one ability with two alternative cost sets (2004-10-04 ruling: pay one or
 * the other, never both), which two `activatedAbility` blocks with identical effects express directly.
 * Both include the shard's own `{T}`, so they compete for the same tap and only one can be activated
 * per untap — the same play pattern as the single printed ability.
 *
 * `colorIdentity = "W"` because the {W} alternative puts white in the card's identity even though the
 * card itself is colorless (CR 903.4).
