/**
 * Ego Erasure
 * {2}{U}
 * Kindred Instant — Shapeshifter
 *
 * Changeling (This card is every creature type.)
 * Creatures target player controls get -2/-0 and lose all creature types until end of turn.
 *
 * The player is the only *target*; the creatures are a group resolved when the spell resolves,
 * so a creature that arrives after the spell was cast is still hit. `targetPlayerControls` binds
 * the group's controller predicate to that target rather than to the spell's controller.
 *
 * Both riders land on each member with [EffectTarget.IterationEntity] inside the iteration — the same shape
 * Surge of Thoughtweft uses — so a creature that leaves mid-resolution simply drops out.
 *
 * Note: "Tribal" was errata'd to "Kindred" in 2024.
