/**
 * Wojek Embermage
 * {3}{R}
 * Creature — Human Wizard
 * 1/2
 *
 * Radiance — {T}: This creature deals 1 damage to target creature and each other creature that
 * shares a color with it.
 *
 * The repeatable half of Cleansing Beam: one target, and a resolution-time group relative to it.
 * The target is damaged directly; the group is every *other* creature sharing a color with the
 * target — `sharingColorWith(EffectTarget.ContextTarget(0))` for the colour test, `otherThanTarget()`
 * so the target isn't hit twice. The Embermage itself is red, so a red target catches it too;
 * "each other creature" is relative to the target, not to the source, and there is no
 * `excludeSelf` here. A colorless target shares a color with nothing, so only it is damaged.
