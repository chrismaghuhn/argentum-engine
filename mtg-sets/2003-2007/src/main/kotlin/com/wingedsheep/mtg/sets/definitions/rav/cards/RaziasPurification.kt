/**
 * Razia's Purification
 * {4}{R}{W}
 * Sorcery
 * Each player chooses three permanents they control, then sacrifices the rest.
 *
 * Global Ruin's shape: inside a [ForEachPlayerEffect] each player gathers the permanents they
 * control, keeps a selection, and sacrifices the remainder. Two details the oracle text pins down:
 *
 * - The keep is [SelectionMode.ChooseExactly] three, not "up to three". A player who wants to keep
 *   fewer doesn't get to — and [SelectionMode.ChooseExactly]'s clamp is exactly right for the
 *   2005-10-01 ruling "if a player doesn't control three permanents, that player chooses all the
 *   permanents they do control and doesn't sacrifice anything": with two permanents the executor
 *   selects both and the remainder is empty.
 * - `Player.Each` walks the table in turn order, and the sacrifice for each player runs as that
 *   player's own step. The second 2005-10-01 ruling wants the choices in turn order and then a
 *   single simultaneous sacrifice; the engine's per-player fold makes the sacrifices sequential
 *   instead. The distinction is only observable through leaves-the-battlefield triggers that count
 *   other permanents mid-resolution, and no other card in this shape (Global Ruin included) models
 *   it differently.
 *
 * "Permanents they control" is every permanent, lands and tokens included — [GameObjectFilter]'s
 * bare `Permanent`, with `Player.You` inside the loop meaning the player being processed.
