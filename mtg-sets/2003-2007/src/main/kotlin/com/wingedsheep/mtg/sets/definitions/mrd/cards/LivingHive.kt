/**
 * Living Hive — Mirrodin #124
 * {6}{G}{G} · Creature — Elemental Insect · 6/6 · Rare
 *
 * Trample
 * Whenever this creature deals combat damage to a player, create that many 1/1 green Insect
 * creature tokens.
 *
 * "That many" is the damage in the triggering payload, read with
 * [ContextPropertyKey.TRIGGER_DAMAGE_AMOUNT] — the same primitive Broodhatch Nantuko uses. It is the
 * damage *actually dealt*, so a pumped or partially-prevented hit makes the matching number of
 * Insects, and a fully-prevented hit never triggers at all.
 *
 * Trample matters here: only the damage assigned to the *player* counts, since the trigger fires off
 * the player-damage event. A 6/6 trampling over a 2/2 blocker deals 4 to the player and hatches four
 * Insects, not six.
