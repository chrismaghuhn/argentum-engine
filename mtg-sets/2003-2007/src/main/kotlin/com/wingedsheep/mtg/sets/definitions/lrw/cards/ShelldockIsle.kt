/**
 * Shelldock Isle
 * Land
 *
 * Hideaway 4 (When this land enters, look at the top four cards of your library, exile
 * one face down, then put the rest on the bottom in a random order.)
 * This land enters tapped.
 * {T}: Add {U}.
 * {U}, {T}: You may play the exiled card without paying its mana cost if a library has
 * twenty or fewer cards in it.
 *
 * The hideaway half is [SpinerockKnoll]'s shape verbatim — see its comment for how the ETB is
 * composed out of gather → select → move.
 *
 * The gate is the interesting line. **"A library" is an existential over *every* player**,
 * including you (2007-10-01: "It doesn't matter which library has twenty or fewer cards in it,
 * and you don't have to specify a library"), and the SDK's only player-boundary aggregation is
 * [DynamicAmount.GreatestAmongPlayers], which takes a *maximum*. A minimum is what this sentence
 * wants and there is no `LeastAmongPlayers`, so the composition takes the maximum of a **0/1
 * indicator** instead: each player is measured on their own ("does *my* library hold 20 or
 * fewer?"), and the greatest of those indicators is 1 exactly when at least one player qualifies.
 *
 * The wrong spellings both read plausibly on the card and both fail:
 *  - `AggregateZone(Player.Each, Zone.LIBRARY)` sums every library into one number, so two
 *    players on 15 cards each would report 30 and never satisfy the gate.
 *  - `AggregateZone(Player.You, Zone.LIBRARY)` silently narrows "a library" to yours, which is
 *    the *opposite* half of the card's real use — you activate this off an opponent milling out.
 *
 * [DynamicAmount.GreatestAmongPlayers] rebinds the resolution context's controller per iteration,
 * so [Player.You] inside the indicator means "the player being measured" — never write an
 * outward reference such as `Player.AnOpponent` there.
 *
 * Modelling the clause as an [ActivationRestriction] rather than a resolution-time check is the
 * same choice the rest of the hideaway cycle makes: a fail-closed gate means the ability is not
 * offered at all below the threshold, which is what the card's "if" does.
