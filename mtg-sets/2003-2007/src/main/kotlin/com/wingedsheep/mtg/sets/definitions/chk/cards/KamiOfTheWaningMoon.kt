/**
 * Kami of the Waning Moon
 * {2}{B}
 * Creature — Spirit
 * 1/1
 * Flying
 * Whenever you cast a Spirit or Arcane spell, target creature gains fear until end of turn.
 *
 * The Kamigawa block's signature payoff trigger. "Whenever you cast a Spirit or Arcane spell" is a
 * `Triggers.you.casts(spell, requires)` over a homogeneous OR of two subtype filters, which the SDK collapses to
 * a single `CardPredicate.Or` — the flat shape the whole engine already resolves subtypes against.
 * The binding is `ANY` (the factory's default), not `OTHER`: the card watches every Spirit or
 * Arcane spell *you* cast, including the one that is this card itself when a later copy is cast
 * while this one is already on the battlefield.
 *
 * "Target creature" is chosen when the trigger goes on the stack, and fear is a plain
 * end-of-turn [Effects.GrantKeyword] — the same channel Gravelgill Duo and Breach use.
