/**
 * Sunhome Enforcer
 * {2}{R}{W}
 * Creature — Giant Soldier
 * 2/4
 * Whenever this creature deals combat damage, you gain that much life.
 * {1}{R}: This creature gets +1/+0 until end of turn.
 *
 * "That much" is the damage the trigger fired on, read live off the event as
 * [ContextPropertyKey.TRIGGER_DAMAGE_AMOUNT]. The trigger names no recipient — combat damage to a
 * player *or* to a blocking creature both count — so it takes the bare `Triggers.<subject>.dealsDamage(to, damageType, requireExcess, batch, requires)`
 * factory rather than one of the recipient-scoped constants.
