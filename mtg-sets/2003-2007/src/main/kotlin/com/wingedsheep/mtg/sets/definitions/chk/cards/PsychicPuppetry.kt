/**
 * Psychic Puppetry
 * {1}{U}
 * Instant — Arcane
 * You may tap or untap target permanent.
 * Splice onto Arcane {U}
 *
 * The Pestermite idiom: a [Effects.May] (the printed "you may") wrapped around a two-[Mode]
 * [ModalEffect] over the one declared target, with `countsAsModalSpell = false` so the tap/untap
 * choice isn't read as a modal *spell* — it's a choice made on resolution, after the target is
 * locked in. That ordering matters: if an opponent taps the permanent in response, you simply pick
 * the untap half instead.
