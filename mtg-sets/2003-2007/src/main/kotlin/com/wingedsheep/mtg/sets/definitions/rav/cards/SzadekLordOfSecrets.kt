/**
 * Szadek, Lord of Secrets — Ravnica: City of Guilds #234
 * {3}{U}{U}{B}{B} · Legendary Creature — Vampire · 5/5
 *
 * Flying
 * If Szadek would deal combat damage to a player, instead put that many +1/+1 counters on Szadek
 * and that player mills that many cards.
 *
 * One [ReplaceDamageWithCounters] carrying both results: counters on its host (Szadek) and, via
 * `damagedPlayerMills`, a mill of the player the damage was headed for. Two separate replacements
 * could not model it — whichever applied first would consume the damage event and the other would
 * never see it. The pattern is Szadek's own combat damage (`GameObjectFilter.Any.sourceItself()`, `DamageType.Combat`)
 * to any player, so noncombat damage and combat damage to creatures or planeswalkers are dealt
 * normally. The damage is replaced, never dealt: no life is lost and "deals combat damage to a
 * player" triggers don't fire. The count is the damage Szadek would actually deal after other
 * modifications (e.g. doubling).
