/**
 * Ringskipper
 * {1}{U}
 * Creature — Faerie Wizard
 * 1/1
 *
 * Flying
 * When this creature dies, clash with an opponent. If you win, return this card to its owner's hand.
 *
 * The clash is unconditional and the *return* is the win rider, so the whole ability is
 * [Patterns.Mechanic.clash] with the return on the `ifYouWin` leg — a lost clash still resolved the
 * clash itself, which matters for "whenever you clash" watchers on either side of the table.
 *
 * By the time the dies trigger resolves the source is already in its owner's graveyard, so
 * [EffectTarget.Self] picks it up there (Angelic Destiny's shape). The move is
 * [Effects.ReturnToHandFromGraveyard] rather than a plain return because the printed ruling calls
 * the guard out explicitly — "if Ringskipper is removed from the graveyard before the ability
 * resolves, you still clash, but nothing will happen if you win" — and that `fromZone = GRAVEYARD`
 * guard is the only thing that re-examines the card at resolution, since the clause names no target.
