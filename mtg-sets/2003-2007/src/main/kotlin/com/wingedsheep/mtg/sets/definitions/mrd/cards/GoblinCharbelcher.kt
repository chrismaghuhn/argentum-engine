/**
 * Goblin Charbelcher — Mirrodin #176 (canonical printing)
 * {4} · Artifact
 *
 * {3}, {T}: Reveal cards from the top of your library until you reveal a land card. This artifact
 * deals damage equal to the number of nonland cards revealed this way to any target. If the
 * revealed land card was a Mountain, this artifact deals double that damage instead. Put the
 * revealed cards on the bottom of your library in any order.
 *
 * The Erratic Explosion shape with the partition inverted: [GatherUntilMatchEffect] walks the
 * library until it hits a *land* rather than a nonland, so the "revealed this way" pile is every
 * card seen and `landCard` holds the single stopper. A [FilterCollectionEffect] splits the
 * nonlands back out because the damage counts them, not the whole reveal — and the two differ by
 * exactly one whenever a land was actually found.
 *
 * The Mountain clause is a [DynamicAmount.Conditional] over that stopper rather than a separate
 * effect branch: "double that damage instead" replaces the amount, so it has to be one damage
 * event. `withSubtype("Mountain")` is the land *type*, not the card name — a Sacred Foundry or a
 * Mountain-typed Blinkmoth Nexus doubles the damage just as a basic Mountain does.
 *
 * Running the library out is the same code path with no stopper: `landCard` stays empty, the
 * condition is false, and every card revealed was nonland, which is the 2016-06-08 ruling
 * ("If you reveal no land cards, Goblin Charbelcher deals damage equal to the number of cards
 * revealed"). The target is chosen at activation, before anything is revealed.
