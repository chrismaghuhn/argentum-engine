/**
 * Scattering Stroke
 * {2}{U}{U}
 * Instant
 *
 * Counter target spell. Clash with an opponent. If you win, at the beginning of your next main
 * phase, you may add an amount of {C} equal to that spell's mana value.
 *
 * Three time-shifts stack up here, and each one is a place the amount can silently read zero:
 *
 *  1. **"That spell" is already gone.** The counter moves it to its owner's graveyard before the
 *     clash even begins, and [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.targets.EffectTarget.ContextTarget] is
 *     `LIVE_ONLY` by design (CR 608.2b) with no target LKI behind it. So the mana value is frozen
 *     up front with the pipeline's `storeNumber` and read back through its handle's
 *     `amount` — the same shape Weed Strangle uses for a destroyed
 *     creature's toughness. Mana Sculpt solves the same problem the other way, by creating its
 *     delayed trigger *before* the counter; that isn't available here because the clash sits
 *     between the two and decides whether the trigger exists at all.
 *  2. **The clash pauses twice** for the two top-or-bottom decisions, so the win rider runs on the
 *     far side of a gated pause and the stored number has to survive it.
 *  3. **The payoff fires a phase later**, when the resolution pipeline that holds the stored number
 *     is gone. `CreateDelayedTriggerExecutor` snapshots an
 *     [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.effects.AddColorlessManaEffect]'s amount into a literal at
 *     creation time for exactly this reason, and it recurses through the [Effects.May] consent gate
 *     to reach it — so the number is baked in while the pipeline can still answer.
 *
 * "You may" is a resolution-time consent gate on the delayed trigger, not a choice made now: the
 * 2007-10-01 ruling says you decide as the delayed ability resolves, and it is all-or-nothing.
 *
 * "Your next main phase" is modelled as the controller's next precombat main phase
 * ([Step.PRECOMBAT_MAIN] gated to [Player.You]) — the same reading Mana Sculpt uses.
 * [DelayedTriggerTiming.CURRENT_TURN_OR_LATER] lets the current turn qualify, which is what an
 * instant cast in your own upkeep wants.
