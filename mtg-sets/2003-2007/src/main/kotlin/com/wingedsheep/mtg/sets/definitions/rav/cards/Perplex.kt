/**
 * Perplex

 * Instant
 *
 * Counter target spell unless its controller discards their hand.
 * Transmute {1}{U}{B}
 *
 * A [PayOrSufferEffect] whose payer is the *target spell's* controller
 * ([EffectTarget.TargetController]) and whose suffer half is a real counter, so an uncounterable
 * spell is untouched and "whenever a spell is countered" triggers still fire.
 *
 * The cost is [Costs.pay.DiscardHand] rather than a counted discard: the number is whatever they
 * hold at resolution, and an empty hand pays it for free (CR 118.3) — so a hellbent opponent
 * always saves their spell, which is the card's known weakness rather than a modelling shortcut.
