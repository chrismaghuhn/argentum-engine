/**
 * Captivating Glance
 * {2}{U}
 * Enchantment — Aura
 * Enchant creature
 * At the beginning of your end step, clash with an opponent. If you win, gain control of enchanted
 * creature. Otherwise, that player gains control of enchanted creature.
 *
 * The card `Patterns.Mechanic.clash`'s `otherwise` leg was written for: both branches of the printed
 * "If you win … Otherwise …" are control changes, differing only in *who* ends up with the creature.
 *
 * The two halves are two existing effects, not one with a controller axis:
 *  - the win leg is [Effects.GainControl], which always gives the ability's controller control;
 *  - the lose leg is [GiveControlToTargetPlayerEffect], the sibling that takes an explicit
 *    [EffectTarget] for the new controller.
 *
 * "That player" is the opponent you clashed with, which the clash pattern has already recorded on
 * this Aura's `ChoiceSlot.OPPONENT` (its `ChooseOpponentForSourceEffect` prefix) — so the lose leg
 * reads it back as [Player.ChosenOpponent] rather than re-picking. That matters even though the two
 * are the same player in a two-player game: per the Scryfall ruling the opponent you clash with need
 * not control the enchanted creature, and per CR 701.30b the choice is made once for the clash.
 *
 * Both executors strip any previous Layer.CONTROL floating effect this Aura put on the same
 * permanent before adding their own, so the end-step trigger toggles control cleanly turn after turn
 * rather than stacking a new effect each time. The control change is `Duration.Permanent` and is not
 * tied to the Aura, matching the ruling that it "continues to apply even if Captivating Glance
 * leaves the battlefield".
