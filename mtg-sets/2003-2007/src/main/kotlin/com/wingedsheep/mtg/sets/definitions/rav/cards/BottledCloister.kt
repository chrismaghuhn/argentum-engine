/**
 * Bottled Cloister — Ravnica: City of Guilds #256
 * {4} · Artifact
 *
 * At the beginning of each opponent's upkeep, exile all cards from your hand face down.
 * At the beginning of your upkeep, return all cards you own exiled with this artifact to your
 * hand, then draw a card.
 *
 * The two halves are a *linked* pair (CR 607): the exile writes the cards onto the Cloister's own
 * `LinkedExileComponent` (`linkToSource = true`, the Shared Fate shape) and the upkeep half reads
 * that same pile back with `CardSource.FromLinkedExile`. That linkage is what makes "exiled with
 * this artifact" mean *this* Cloister's pile and not every card in exile.
 *
 * [FaceDownMode.HIDDEN] is a face-down exile with no turn-up: opponents can't read the hand they
 * just made you put away.
 *
 * The `ownedByYou()` filter on the return is the 2006 errata ("only the cards you own go into your
 * hand"): if control of the Cloister changes mid-turn the pile can hold two players' cards, and
 * only the current controller's own cards come back. Everything left in the pile stays exiled —
 * including everything in it if the Cloister leaves the battlefield before your upkeep.
