/**
 * Compulsive Research
 * {2}{U}
 * Sorcery
 *
 * Target player draws three cards. Then that player discards two cards unless they discard a land card.
 *
 * The targeted twin of Thirst for Discovery: both halves run on the *target*, not the controller, so
 * the draw and the discard-gate both take the same target handle. The discard is one selection, not
 * two decisions — a single land card satisfies it, otherwise two cards must be selected. Any land
 * card counts, basic or not (unlike Thirst for Discovery, which demands a basic).
