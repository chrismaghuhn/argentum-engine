/**
 * Dreamspoiler Witches
 * {3}{B}
 * Creature — Faerie Wizard
 * 2/2
 * Flying
 * Whenever you cast a spell during an opponent's turn, you may have target creature get -1/-1
 * until end of turn.
 *
 * The Lorwyn Faerie payoff for holding up flash and instants. "During an opponent's turn" is
 * checked when the ability would trigger, so it rides on `triggerRestriction`
 * ([Conditions.IsOpponentsTurn]) rather than gating the resolved effect. It is not merely "not
 * your turn": an ally's turn is not an opponent's. Same shape as [DreamSpoilers] in Wilds of
 * Eldraine, which is a strictly-worse reprint of this idea.
 *
 * The target is mandatory (not "up to one"), so the ability is only put on the stack when there is
 * a creature to point at; the "you may" is a decline made on resolution.
