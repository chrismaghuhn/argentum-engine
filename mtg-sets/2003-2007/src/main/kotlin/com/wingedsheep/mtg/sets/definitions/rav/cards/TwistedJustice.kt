/**
 * Twisted Justice — Ravnica: City of Guilds #237 (canonical printing, only printing)
 * {4}{U}{B} · Sorcery
 *
 * Target player sacrifices a creature of their choice. You draw cards equal to that creature's
 * power.
 *
 * An edict with a payoff riding on the victim, so the whole card is the seam between the two steps:
 * by the time the draw counts power, the creature is already in the graveyard. Both halves are
 * existing primitives and the seam is already load-bearing elsewhere (Kylox, Visionary Inventor):
 *
 * - `Effects.Sacrifice(Creature, 1, <target player>)` is the Diabolic Edict half — the *player*
 *   chooses which creature, which is what "of their choice" means (the sacrifice is not a target).
 * - The sacrifice captures a last-known-information snapshot per sacrificed permanent (CR 608.2h)
 *   and `CompositeEffect` merges it into the resolving context, so
 *   `DynamicAmounts.totalPowerSacrificedThisWay()` reads the creature's power *as it last existed
 *   on the battlefield* — the only reading of "that creature's power" that can be correct here.
 *
 * A target player with no creatures sacrifices nothing and the amount is 0, so you draw nothing;
 * the spell still resolves. Negative power likewise draws nothing (the draw floors at 0).
