/**
 * Mark of Eviction
 * {U}
 * Enchantment — Aura
 *
 * Enchant creature
 * At the beginning of your upkeep, return enchanted creature and all Auras attached to that
 * creature to their owners' hands.
 *
 * Mark of Eviction is itself an Aura attached to that creature, so it bounces *itself* along
 * with the host — that recursion is the card, not an accident of the script.
 *
 * Hence the gather-first shape. The Auras are collected into a pipeline collection while
 * everything is still attached; only then does the host move, and the collection (entity ids,
 * not a live attachment read) moves after it. Returning the Auras first instead would leave the
 * later steps reading "enchanted creature" off an Aura that is already in its owner's hand.
 * Nothing dies in between: an Aura attached to nothing is put into a graveyard by a state-based
 * action (CR 704.5m), and state-based actions are not checked in the middle of a resolution.
 *
 * Equipment attached to the host is deliberately left alone — the printed text names Auras, and
 * an unattached Equipment simply stays on the battlefield.
