 * Windbrisk Heights

 * Hideaway 4 (When this land enters, look at the top four cards of your library, exile
 * one face down, then put the rest on the bottom in a random order.)
 * This land enters tapped.

 * {W}, {T}: You may play the exiled card without paying its mana cost if you attacked with
 * three or more creatures this turn.
 *
 * Same shape as [MosswortBridge] — see its comment for how hideaway is composed. The gate is
 * the attack tracker rather than a board scan: per the 2007-10-01 ruling it asks whether you
 * *declared* three or more creatures as attackers at any point this turn, so it must survive
 * those creatures dying, a second combat phase, and the attack being over. A creature declared
 * in two combats counts once, and a creature that entered the battlefield already attacking was
 * never declared and so never counts — both of which the tracker already gets right.
