/**
 * Bosh, Iron Golem — Mirrodin #147
 * {8} · Legendary Artifact Creature — Golem · 6/7
 *
 * Trample
 * {3}{R}, Sacrifice an artifact: Bosh deals damage equal to the sacrificed artifact's mana value
 * to any target.
 *
 * The textbook sacrifice-cost-feeds-the-effect shape, and it needs no engine work: the
 * [Costs.Sacrifice] cost binds the sacrificed artifact to [EffectTarget.SacrificedAsCost], whose
 * last-known information is captured at cost payment, and the damage amount reads
 * [EntityNumericProperty.ManaValue] off that snapshot (same wiring as Priest of Yawgmoth).
 *
 * Two rulings ride on that:
 *  - Bosh is itself an artifact and the filter doesn't exclude the source, so **Bosh can be
 *    sacrificed to its own ability** — the damage is still dealt, from the graveyard, using
 *    last-known information (CR 608.2h).
 *  - An {X} in an artifact's mana cost is 0 on the battlefield (CR 202.3b), so sacrificing an
 *    X-cost artifact deals damage equal to the rest of its cost only.
