/**
 * Footbottom Feast
 * {2}{B}
 * Instant
 * Put any number of target creature cards from your graveyard on top of your library.
 * Draw a card.
 *
 * Drafna's Restoration's shape, scoped to your own graveyard: one `unlimited = true` target slot
 * ("any number of target …", so zero is a legal choice and the spell still resolves for the
 * cantrip), gathered with [CardSource.ChosenTargets] and moved to the top of your library.
 *
 * The printed text has no "in any order", but CR 401.4 gives the order to the effect's controller
 * whenever a spell puts two or more cards on top of a library without specifying one — hence
 * [CardOrder.ControllerChooses]. The draw is sequenced *after* the move, so a single creature card
 * put back on top is the card you then draw.
