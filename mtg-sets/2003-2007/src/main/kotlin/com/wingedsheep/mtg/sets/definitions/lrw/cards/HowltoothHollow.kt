/**
 * Howltooth Hollow
 * Land
 *
 * Hideaway 4 (When this land enters, look at the top four cards of your library, exile
 * one face down, then put the rest on the bottom in a random order.)
 * This land enters tapped.
 * {T}: Add {B}.
 * {B}, {T}: You may play the exiled card without paying its mana cost if each player has
 * no cards in hand.
 *
 * Same shape as [MosswortBridge] — see its comment for how hideaway is composed. The only
 * difference is the gate on the free-cast ability: "each player has no cards in hand" is
 * modelled as the *summed* hand size across every seat being zero, which is exactly the
 * universal claim (a sum of non-negative counts is 0 iff every term is 0) and so stays
 * correct in multiplayer, where a per-opponent comparison would not.
