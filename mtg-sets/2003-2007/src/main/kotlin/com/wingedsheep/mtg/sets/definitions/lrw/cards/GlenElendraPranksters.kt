/**
 * Glen Elendra Pranksters
 * {3}{U}
 * Creature — Faerie Wizard
 * 1/3
 * Flying
 * Whenever you cast a spell during an opponent's turn, you may return target creature you control
 * to its owner's hand.
 *
 * The blue half of the [DreamspoilerWitches] cycle: the same `triggerRestriction`
 * ([Conditions.IsOpponentsTurn]) over a different payoff, here rebuying your own enters-the-
 * battlefield creatures at instant speed.
 *
 * The bounce targets a creature *you* control, and it goes to its **owner's** hand — a creature you
 * gained control of returns to the player who owns it, not to you.
