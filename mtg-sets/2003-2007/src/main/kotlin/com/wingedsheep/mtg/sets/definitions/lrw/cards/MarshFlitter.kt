/**
 * Marsh Flitter
 * {3}{B}
 * Creature — Faerie Rogue
 * 1/1
 * Flying
 * When this creature enters, create two 1/1 black Goblin Rogue creature tokens.
 * Sacrifice a Goblin: This creature has base power and toughness 3/3 until end of turn.
 *
 * The two Goblins it brings are the fodder for its own ability, but the cost is any Goblin — and
 * the bare tribal noun means any Goblin *permanent* you control, not just creatures.
 *
 * "Has base power and toughness 3/3" *sets* the base (layer 7b) rather than pumping, so a second
 * activation is redundant while the first is still in effect, and +1/+1 counters still apply on top
 * of it. The Flitter is a Faerie, never a Goblin, so it can't feed itself.
