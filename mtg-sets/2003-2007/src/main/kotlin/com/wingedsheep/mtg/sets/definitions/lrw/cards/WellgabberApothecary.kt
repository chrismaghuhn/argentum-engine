/**
 * Wellgabber Apothecary
 * {4}{W}
 * Creature — Merfolk Cleric
 * 2/3
 * {1}{W}: Prevent all damage that would be dealt to target tapped Merfolk or Kithkin creature this turn.
 *
 * "Tapped Merfolk or Kithkin creature" is one noun phrase, so it is one filter — `tapped()` plus a
 * [GameObjectFilter.withAnySubtype] union — not a [TargetFilter.or] of two clauses, which is for
 * targets that span different zones. Every other [Effects.PreventDamage] parameter stays at its default: a null
 * `amount` is "prevent all", the scope covers non-combat damage, and the duration is "this turn".
 * The ability has no tap symbol, so it can be activated repeatedly.
