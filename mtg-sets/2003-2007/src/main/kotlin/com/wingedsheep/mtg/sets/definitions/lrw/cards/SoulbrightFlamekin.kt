/**
 * Soulbright Flamekin — Lorwyn #190
 * {1}{R} · Creature — Elemental Shaman · 2/1
 *
 * {2}: Target creature gains trample until end of turn. If this is the third time this ability
 * has resolved this turn, you may add {R}{R}{R}{R}{R}{R}{R}{R}.
 *
 * Shares its whole shape with [InnerFlameIgniter]: pay off the printed clause, bump the source's
 * per-turn resolution tally with [IncrementAbilityResolutionCountEffect], then gate the rider on
 * [Conditions.SourceAbilityResolvedNTimes] reading that tally back. The equality (not a
 * threshold) is what makes the ruling "you won't get the bonus the fourth, fifth, sixth …" fall
 * out for free.
 *
 * "**You may** add" is a real decision, not a selection that can be declined, so the mana sits
 * under [Effects.May] — eight red mana that must be spent this step is often a liability, and CR
 * 106.4 wants the player asked.
 *
 * The ability **targets**, so it is not a mana ability (its own ruling says so, CR 605.1a): it
 * uses the stack and can be responded to. Nothing on the card says that — the engine derives
 * `manaAbility` from the presence of a target requirement, so declaring the target is the whole
 * of it.
