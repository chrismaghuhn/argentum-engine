/**
 * Induce Paranoia — Ravnica: City of Guilds #56
 * {2}{U}{U} · Instant
 *
 * Counter target spell. If {B} was spent to cast this spell, that spell's controller mills X cards,
 * where X is the spell's mana value.
 *
 * Another of Ravnica's "if {X} was spent" riders: the card is mono-blue and the black mana is a
 * *payment* question, so a Dimir land or an any-colour source switches the mill on.
 *
 * Both halves of the rider read the countered spell *after* it has already been put into its
 * owner's graveyard, which is why they use the last-known-information references rather than a live
 * battlefield lookup: `Player.ControllerOf` resolves the spell's controller as of the counter, and
 * `targetManaValue` reads the mana value off the card it became. "The spell's mana value" is the
 * countered spell's, not Induce Paranoia's — X for an X spell on the stack counts as the value
 * chosen for it (CR 202.3b).
