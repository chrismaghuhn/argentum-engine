/**
 * Loxodon Hierarch
 * {2}{G}{W}
 * Creature — Elephant Cleric
 * 4/4
 *
 * When this creature enters, you gain 4 life.
 * {G}{W}, Sacrifice this creature: Regenerate each creature you control.
 *
 * "Regenerate each creature you control" is [Effects.ForEachInGroup] over the creatures you
 * control with a body of `RegenerateEffect(EffectTarget.IterationEntity)` — `IterationSpace.Group` binds the
 * current permanent as the body's `IterationEntity`, so the single-target regeneration facade applies once
 * per creature. That composition is what the ruling below describes: each creature gets its own
 * regeneration shield, spent independently and expiring at end of turn, rather than one shared
 * shield for the board.
 *
 * The Hierarch never regenerates itself. `Costs.SacrificeSelf` is paid on activation, so it is
 * already in the graveyard when the ability resolves and the group snapshot is taken.
