/**
 * Indentured Oaf
 * {3}{R}
 * Creature — Ogre Warrior
 * 4/3
 *
 * Prevent all damage that this creature would deal to red creatures.
 *
 * A continuous [PreventDamage] replacement (CR 615) scoped on both sides: source is the Oaf itself
 * (`GameObjectFilter.Any.sourceItself()`) and the recipient is any red creature. The recipient filter is evaluated
 * against projected state at the moment damage would be dealt, so a creature that has been made red
 * — or has lost red — since blockers were declared is judged on its colour *then*, and the Oaf's own
 * controller is not spared: the sentence says "red creatures", not "red creatures an opponent
 * controls".
