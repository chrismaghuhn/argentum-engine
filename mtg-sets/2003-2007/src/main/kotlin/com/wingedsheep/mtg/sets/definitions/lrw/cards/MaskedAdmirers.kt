/**
 * Masked Admirers
 * {2}{G}{G}
 * Creature — Elf Shaman
 * 3/2
 * When this creature enters, draw a card.
 * Whenever you cast a creature spell, you may pay {G}{G}. If you do, return this card from your
 * graveyard to your hand.
 *
 * The recursion ability functions only from the graveyard (CR 113.6b), so it is zone-scoped with
 * `triggerZone = Zone.GRAVEYARD` the way Squee, Goblin Nabob is — without it the trigger would be
 * indexed only while Masked Admirers is on the battlefield, where it can do nothing.
 *
 * "You may pay {G}{G}. If you do, …" is a [Gate.MayPay], not a plain `optional = true`: the return
 * happens iff the mana is actually paid. [Effects.ReturnToHandFromGraveyard] carries the
 * `fromZone` guard the *self*-return needs — nothing re-examines the card at resolution, so a
 * Masked Admirers exiled from the graveyard in response would otherwise come back from exile.
