/**
 * Hunted Troll — Ravnica: City of Guilds #170
 * {2}{G}{G} · Creature — Troll Warrior · 8/4
 *
 * When this creature enters, target opponent creates four 1/1 blue Faerie creature tokens with
 * flying.
 * {G}: Regenerate this creature.
 *
 * The green member of the Hunted cycle. The four flying Faeries are the drawback the regeneration
 * is meant to survive: an 8/4 dies to four 1/1 fliers chump-blocking into it exactly never, but it
 * folds to the removal those Faeries buy time for, and {G} answers that.
 *
 * There is no `Effects.Regenerate` facade — [RegenerateEffect] on [EffectTarget.Self] is the
 * shipped spelling (Cudgel Troll, Woodwraith Strangler). The Faeries enter under the *targeted
 * opponent's* control via [Effects.CreateToken]'s `controller`, as with the rest of the cycle.
