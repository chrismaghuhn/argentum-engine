/**
 * Cloudstone Curio — Ravnica: City of Guilds #257
 * {3} · Artifact · Rare
 *
 * Whenever a nonartifact permanent you control enters, you may return another permanent you
 * control that shares a permanent type with it to its owner's hand.
 *
 * The bounce is a non-targeted choice made on resolution, so it is a battlefield pipeline: gather
 * every permanent you control that `sharingCardTypeWith(EffectTarget.TriggeringEntity)` — both sides
 * read projected types, so an animated land that enters can bounce a creature — with
 * `excludeTriggering` carrying the printed "another", then `chooseUpTo(1)` is the "you may"
 * (zero picks is the decline) and the move routes the card to its *owner's* hand, as printed.
 * `useTargetingUI` puts the pick on the battlefield rather than in an overlay.
 *
 * "Permanent type" is spelled with the card-type predicate. The two differ only for Kindred,
 * which the Comprehensive Rules list as a card type but not as a permanent type; the Curio would let a
 * Kindred creature bounce a Kindred enchantment where the printed card would not. Nothing in the
 * SDK narrows a card-type comparison to permanent types yet, and the case is rare enough that
 * the card ships with the wider reading rather than waiting on it.
 *
 * The Curio never triggers on itself (it is an artifact) and `TriggerBinding.ANY` is what lets
 * it see the *other* permanents entering; a token entering under your control counts too.
