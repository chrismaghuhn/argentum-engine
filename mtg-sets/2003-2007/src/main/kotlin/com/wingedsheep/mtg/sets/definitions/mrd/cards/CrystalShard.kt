/**
 * Crystal Shard — Mirrodin #159 (canonical printing)
 * {3} · Artifact
 *
 * {3}, {T} or {U}, {T}: Return target creature to its owner's hand unless its controller pays {1}.
 *
 * The blue member of the Mirrodin Shard cycle. The dual cost is modelled the same way as
 * [GraniteShard] and [PearlShard]: one printed ability with two alternative cost sets becomes two
 * `activatedAbility` blocks with identical effects (2004-10-04 ruling: pay one or the other, never
 * both), competing for the shard's single `{T}`.
 *
 * "Unless its controller pays {1}" is an *inverted* gate — the bounce is the `otherwise` branch, so
 * paying is what stops it. Both halves of the gate point at the targeted creature's controller
 * rather than the shard's: `decisionMaker = TargetController` prompts them, and
 * `PayDynamicMana(payer = ControllerOf(...))` charges them. `Gate.MayPay` skips the prompt entirely
 * when the cost is unpayable and goes straight to the bounce, so a tapped-out opponent is never
 * offered an impossible "yes". The `then` branch is deliberately empty — a paid {1} simply keeps the
 * creature where it is.
 *
 * `colorIdentity = "U"` because the {U} alternative puts blue in the card's identity even though the
 * card itself is colorless (CR 903.4).
