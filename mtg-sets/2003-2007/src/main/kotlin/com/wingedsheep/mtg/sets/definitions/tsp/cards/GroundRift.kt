/**
 * Ground Rift
 * {R}
 * Sorcery
 * Target creature without flying can't block this turn.
 * Storm (When you cast this spell, copy it for each spell cast before it this turn. You may
 * choose new targets for the copies.)
 *
 * "Without flying" is a restriction on the *target*, not the effect: `NotKeyword(FLYING)` on
 * the requirement's filter, so a creature that gains flying in response is no longer a legal
 * target and the spell (or that copy) fizzles under CR 608.2b.
 *
 * Storm copies the spell off `script.spellEffect`, so this stays a plain `spell { effect = … }`.
