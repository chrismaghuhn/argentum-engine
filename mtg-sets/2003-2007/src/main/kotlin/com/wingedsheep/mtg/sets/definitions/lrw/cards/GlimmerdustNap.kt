/**
 * Glimmerdust Nap
 * {2}{U}
 * Enchantment — Aura
 * Enchant tapped creature
 * Enchanted creature doesn't untap during its controller's untap step.
 *
 * The "tapped" restriction lives in the enchant clause only, so it is checked when the Aura is
 * cast and by the state-based attachment check — a creature that untaps later (through another
 * effect) keeps the Aura. `DOESNT_UNTAP` is the narrow untap-step flag rather than
 * `CANT_BECOME_UNTAPPED`: a Twiddle still untaps the napper.
