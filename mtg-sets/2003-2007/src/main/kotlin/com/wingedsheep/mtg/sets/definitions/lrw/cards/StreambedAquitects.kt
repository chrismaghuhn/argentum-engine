 * Streambed Aquitects
 * {1}{U}{U}
 * Creature — Merfolk Scout
 * 2/3
 * {T}: Target Merfolk creature gets +1/+1 and gains islandwalk until end of turn.
 * {T}: Target land becomes an Island until end of turn.
 *
 * Two independently-targeted tap abilities that read as one plan: the second makes the defender's
 * land an Island so the first's islandwalk actually turns off blocking. "Becomes an Island"
 * *replaces* the land's subtypes (CR 305.7), hence [Effects.SetLandType] and not the additive
 * `AddSubtype` — the same distinction Dream Thrush documents.
