/**
 * Lairwatch Giant
 * {5}{W}
 * Creature — Giant Warrior
 * 5/3
 *
 * This creature can block an additional creature each combat.
 * Whenever this creature blocks two or more creatures, it gains first strike until end of turn.
 *
 * The two halves are one card: the first is what makes the second reachable, so the extra block is
 * [CanBlockAdditionalForCreatureGroup] scoped to [GroupFilter.source] (Selesnya Sagittars' shape).
 *
 * "Blocks two or more creatures" is a *count* over the blocks declared this combat, which is the
 * `minBlockedAttackers` bar on `BlockEvent` — the blocking mirror of
 * `CreaturesAttackYourOpponentEvent.minAttackers`. It deliberately fires **once** per combat rather
 * than once per blocked attacker: the printed wording is a single event, and the 2007-10-01 ruling
 * says an already-two-blocking Giant pushed to three by a later effect does *not* trigger again.
 *
 * Known limit, and it is the ruling's other half: the trigger is read off the
 * `BlockersDeclaredEvent`, so a Giant that blocks only one creature at declaration and is pushed to
 * two by a later effect will not trigger. The engine emits no event for a mid-combat change to the
 * block assignment, so there is nothing to detect on; closing it means a new event, not a new field.
