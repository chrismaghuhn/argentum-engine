 *
 * Radiance: the target is untapped and pumped directly; every *other* creature sharing a color
 * with it (`sharingColorWith(EffectTarget.ContextTarget(0))`, `otherThanTarget()`) is gathered once
 * as the spell resolves and untapped-then-pumped in the same pass — "those creatures" is the
 * group the first sentence named, so it isn't re-evaluated for the pump. A colorless target
 * shares a color with nothing, so only it is affected.
