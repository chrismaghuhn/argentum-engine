/**
 * Myr Incubator — Mirrodin #212
 * {6} · Artifact · Rare
 *
 * {6}, {T}, Sacrifice this artifact: Search your library for any number of artifact cards, exile
 * them, then create that many 1/1 colorless Myr artifact creature tokens. Then shuffle.
 *
 * One Gather → Select → Move pipeline, no new vocabulary:
 *
 *  1. `gather(FromZone(LIBRARY, You, Artifact))` snapshots the artifact cards in your library.
 *  2. `chooseAnyNumber(...)` is the literal "any number" — zero is a legal search result (CR 701.23b),
 *     so declining finds nothing, makes no tokens, and still shuffles.
 *  3. `exile(...)` moves the whole found collection to exile.
 *  4. "that many" is [DynamicAmount.DistinctEntitiesInCollections] over the found slot, evaluated
 *     after the move — the collection tracks entity ids, which survive the zone change — so the token
 *     count is the number of cards *actually* exiled rather than the number asked for.
 *  5. [ShuffleLibraryEffect] is the trailing "Then shuffle", and
 *     [EmitLibrarySearchedEventEffect] fires the "whenever a player searches their library" triggers
 *     (CR 701.23) that every other search primitive emits.
 *
 * The exile is a plain one-way exile, not a linked one: nothing on this card ever refers back to the
 * exiled cards, and the tokens are ordinary tokens rather than copies of them.
