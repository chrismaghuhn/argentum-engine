/**
 * Eye of the Storm — Ravnica: City of Guilds #48
 * {5}{U}{U} · Enchantment
 *
 * Whenever a player casts an instant or sorcery card, exile it. Then that player copies each
 * instant or sorcery card exiled with this enchantment. For each copy, the player may cast the
 * copy without paying its mana cost.
 *
 * - "casts an instant or sorcery **card**" is [SpellCastPredicate.IsCard]: the copies this
 *   ability hands out are cast too (CR 707.12), and a copy of a card is not a card, so they don't
 *   re-trigger it (the card's third ruling).
 * - "exile it" is [Effects.ExileTriggeringSpell] linked to the enchantment — the spell leaves the
 *   stack without resolving and joins the pile `CardSource.FromLinkedExile()` reads.
 * - "that player copies … may cast" runs inside `ForEachPlayer(TriggeringPlayer)`, which rebinds
 *   the controller to the caster, so the copies are theirs and the cast choices are theirs. The
 *   pile includes cards other players cast (the fourth ruling). Copies are cast one at a time in
 *   the order the player picks them; any left uncast cease to exist (CR 707.10a).
