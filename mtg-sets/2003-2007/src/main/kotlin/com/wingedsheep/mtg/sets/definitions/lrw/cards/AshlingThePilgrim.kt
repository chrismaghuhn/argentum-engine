/**
 * Ashling the Pilgrim — Lorwyn #149
 * {1}{R} · Legendary Creature — Elemental Shaman · 1/1
 *
 * {1}{R}: Put a +1/+1 counter on Ashling. If this is the third time this ability has resolved
 * this turn, remove all +1/+1 counters from Ashling, and it deals that much damage to each
 * creature and each player.
 *
 * The per-turn tally is Lorwyn's own [IncrementAbilityResolutionCountEffect] /
 * [Conditions.SourceAbilityResolvedNTimes] pair, shared with [SoulbrightFlamekin] and
 * [InnerFlameIgniter]. The equality (not a threshold) is what makes the ruling "you won't get
 * the bonus the fourth, fifth, sixth …" fall out for free, and counting *resolutions* rather
 * than activations is the executor's own contract — a countered activation never reaches it.
 *
 * **"That much" has to be read before the counters are gone**, so the count is captured with
 * [Effects.StoreNumber] and the damage reads it back through
 * [DynamicAmount.VariableReference] (Lightning Coils' shape). Reading
 * `countersOnSelf` directly in the damage step would evaluate *after* the removal and deal 0.
 * The order on the card is load-bearing for a second reason: Ashling is a 1/1 again by the time
 * the damage lands, so three counters kill it — the ruling's "it's likely that the damage will
 * kill Ashling".
 *
 * The counter is put on *first* and the tally bumped after it, so the third activation's counter
 * is included in "that much": three activations mean three counters and three damage.
 *
 * Damage to "each creature and each player" is the Earthquake shape — a
 * [Effects.ForEachInGroup] over [GroupFilter.AllCreatures] (Ashling itself included) followed by
 * [Effects.ForEachPlayer] over [Player.Each]. The stored number survives the player loop: only
 * stored *collections* are reset per iteration, not stored numbers.
