/**
 * Heat Shimmer
 * {2}{R}
 * Sorcery
 * Create a token that's a copy of target creature, except it has haste and
 * "At the beginning of the end step, exile this token."
 *
 * The exile sibling of Electroduplicate: the same `addedKeywords = HASTE` copy exception, but the
 * token is *exiled* rather than sacrificed, so it triggers no dies/leaves-the-battlefield
 * abilities of its own. `exileAtStep = Step.END` fires on the next end step of **any** player's
 * turn — the printed text says "the end step", not "your end step" — so a Heat Shimmer cast on an
 * opponent's turn loses the token that same turn.
 *
 * Unlike Electroduplicate, the target is any creature on the battlefield, not just one you
 * control: this is red's take on a Clone, and stealing the mould off an opponent's best creature
 * for one attack is the point.
