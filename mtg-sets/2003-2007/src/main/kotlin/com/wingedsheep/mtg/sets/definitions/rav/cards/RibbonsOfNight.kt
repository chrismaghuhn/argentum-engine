/**
 * Ribbons of Night — Ravnica: City of Guilds #101
 * {4}{B} · Sorcery
 *
 * Ribbons of Night deals 4 damage to target creature and you gain 4 life. If {U} was spent to cast
 * this spell, draw a card.
 *
 * One of Ravnica's hybrid-flavoured "if {X} was spent" riders: the spell is mono-black and always
 * does the damage and the lifegain, and the blue clause is a *payment* question, not a colour
 * requirement — casting it with a Dimir land or an any-colour source turns the extra card on.
 * `Conditions.ManaSpentToCastIncludes` reads the payment recorded on the spell itself, so the rider
 * is checked on resolution (CR 608.2) against what was actually paid, and a copy of the spell —
 * which was never cast and so had no mana spent for it — correctly misses the rider.
