/**
 * Flame Fusillade — Ravnica: City of Guilds #123
 * {3}{R} · Sorcery
 *
 * Until end of turn, permanents you control gain "{T}: This permanent deals 1 damage to any target."
 *
 * The Viridian Longbow grant, fanned over a group and time-boxed: `ForEachInGroup` snapshots the
 * permanents you control *as this resolves* (CR 611.2c — a permanent that enters later does not
 * gain the ability) and hands each one the same `{T}` pinger for the turn. `EffectTarget.Self`
 * means the iterated permanent at grant time, and the *host* again inside the granted ability, so
 * the `{T}` taps that permanent and it is the source of the damage (CR 113.7).
 *
 * Summoning sickness gates only creatures, so a land or artifact that entered this turn can shoot
 * immediately — the card's own ruling.
