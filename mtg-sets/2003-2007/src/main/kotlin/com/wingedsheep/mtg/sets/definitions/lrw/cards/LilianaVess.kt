 * −8: Put all creature cards from all graveyards onto the battlefield under your control.

 * The +1 targets a *player*, who chooses what to discard. The −2 is the Vampiric Tutor shape —
 * [SearchDestination.TOP_OF_LIBRARY] shuffles first and then places the found card on top. The
 * −8 is the Rise of the Dark Realms gather: every graveyard ([Player.Each]) is read, and the
 * collection moves to the battlefield under the resolving player's control.
