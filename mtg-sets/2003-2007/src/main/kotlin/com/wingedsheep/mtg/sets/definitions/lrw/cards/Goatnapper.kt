/**
 * Goatnapper
 * {2}{R}
 * Creature — Goblin Rogue
 * 2/2
 * When this creature enters, untap target Goat and gain control of it until end of turn.
 * It gains haste until end of turn.
 *
 * The Threaten pattern hung off an enters trigger: the same
 * `Untap` + `GainControl(EndOfTurn)` + `GrantKeyword(HASTE)` composite Blind with Anger uses,
 * with the target narrowed to a Goat.
 *
 * "Target Goat" is any Goat on the battlefield, not just an opponent's — stealing your own Goat
 * back from nobody is legal (and pointless), and the untap/haste half still applies. Lorwyn's own
 * Goats are Cloudgoat Ranger's tokens and Springjack Pasture's Goats, but the changeling cycle
 * makes every changeling a legal target too, which is exactly why the filter is a subtype test on
 * *projected* state rather than a printed-type read.
