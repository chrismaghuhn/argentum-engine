/**
 * Ghosts of the Innocent
 * {5}{W}{W}
 * Creature — Spirit
 * 4/5
 *
 * If a source would deal damage to a permanent or player, it deals half that damage, rounded
 * down, to that permanent or player instead.
 *
 * The dividing mirror of Furnace of Rath, and the reason it needs its own [HalveDamage]
 * replacement rather than a `ModifyDamageAmount`: the reduction is *multiplicative*, scaling with
 * the incoming amount, which no `DynamicAmount` can read. Everything else falls out of that —
 * half of 1 rounded down is 0 (a 1-damage source deals nothing), and three copies compound
 * 14 → 7 → 3 → 1, because each applicable replacement applies once (CR 616.1).
 *
 * `Recipient.Any` is the "a permanent **or** player" half: unlike most of the damage family
 * this card scopes neither by recipient nor by source, so every damage event in the game is
 * halved — including damage dealt to the Ghosts themselves and to their controller.
 *
 * It is emphatically **not** a prevention effect, which is what makes it the one thing on the
 * battlefield that still shrinks Excruciator's damage (also in this set).
