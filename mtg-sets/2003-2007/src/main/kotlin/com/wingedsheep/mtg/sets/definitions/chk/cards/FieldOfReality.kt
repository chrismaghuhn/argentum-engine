/**
 * Field of Reality
 * {2}{U}
 * Enchantment — Aura
 *
 * Enchant creature
 * Enchanted creature can't be blocked by Spirits.
 * {1}{U}: Return this Aura to its owner's hand.
 *
 * "Enchant creature" is the `auraTarget` declaration — without it the Aura has nothing to attach
 * to. The evasion clause is a [CantBeBlockedBy] static scoped to [GroupFilter.attachedCreature],
 * so it follows the enchanted creature rather than the Aura itself. "Spirits" is a bare tribal
 * noun with no "creature" after it, so the blocker filter is `Permanent.withSubtype("Spirit")`
 * (blockers are creatures anyway; the printed word decides the filter). The self-bounce is the
 * ordinary [Effects.Move] of [EffectTarget.Self] to hand.
