/**
 * Chant of Vitu-Ghazi — Ravnica: City of Guilds #7
 * {6}{W}{W} · Instant
 *
 * Convoke
 * Prevent all damage that would be dealt by creatures this turn. You gain life equal to the damage
 * prevented this way.
 *
 * One source-side prevention shield ([Effects.PreventDamage] `FromTarget`) over every creature, with
 * `gainLifeFromPrevented`: *all* damage, not only combat damage — a creature's pinging ability is
 * stopped too — and the creature filter is re-read each time damage would be dealt, so a creature
 * that enters later this turn is covered. The life is the amount the shield actually prevents, as
 * it prevents it ("you gain life each time that shield prevents 1 or more damage"): a combat damage
 * step is one simultaneous event and gives one combined gain, while each noncombat instance gives
 * its own. Damage some other effect has already prevented, and damage that can't be prevented, is
 * never counted.
