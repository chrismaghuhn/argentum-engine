/**
 * Concerted Effort — Ravnica: City of Guilds #8
 * {2}{W}{W} · Enchantment
 *
 * At the beginning of each upkeep, creatures you control gain flying until end of turn if a
 * creature you control has flying. The same is true for fear, first strike, double strike,
 * landwalk, protection, trample, and vigilance.
 *
 * The Odric, Lunarch Marshal shape: one [Effects.If] per fixed keyword, each fanning an
 * end-of-turn grant over the creatures you control with [Effects.ForEachInGroup]. The gates are
 * resolution-time tests and the grants are snapshotted per creature, which is exactly the rulings:
 * creatures keep what they gained even if Concerted Effort or the creature that supplied it leaves.
 *
 * "Landwalk" means every landwalk *variant* a creature has — each is its own keyword (swampwalk,
 * forestwalk, …, nonbasic landwalk), so each is its own clause. "Protection" is parameterised by
 * quality, so it can't be a fixed-keyword clause: [Effects.GrantProtectionsSharedByGroup] reads
 * every protection any creature you control has and grants all of them — the ruling's creature
 * with protection from red plus one with protection from green give everyone both. It needs no
 * gate: with no protection in the group it grants nothing.
 *
 * "Each upkeep" is `Triggers.anyPlayer.beginningOf(Step.UPKEEP)`, so it works on opponents' turns as well.
