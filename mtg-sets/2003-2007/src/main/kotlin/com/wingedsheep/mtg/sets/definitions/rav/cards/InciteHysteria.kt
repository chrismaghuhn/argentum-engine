 * Radiance — Until end of turn, target creature and each other creature that shares a color with
 * it gain "This creature can't block."
 *
 * Radiance: the target is restricted directly; every *other* creature sharing a color with it
 * (`sharingColorWith(EffectTarget.ContextTarget(0))`, `otherThanTarget()`) is found as the spell
 * resolves and restricted too. The restriction is stamped on the creatures at resolution, so a
 * creature that changes colour before blockers are declared still can't block (2005-11-01
 * ruling), and one that becomes the target's colour afterwards is unaffected. A colorless target
 * shares a color with nothing, so only it is restricted.
