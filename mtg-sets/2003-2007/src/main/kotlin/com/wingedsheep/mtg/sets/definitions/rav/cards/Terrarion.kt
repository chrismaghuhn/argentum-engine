/**
 * Terrarion
 * {1}
 * Artifact
 *
 * This artifact enters tapped.
 * {2}, {T}, Sacrifice this artifact: Add two mana in any combination of colors.
 * When this artifact is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, draw a card.
 *
 * The sacrifice is part of the *cost*, so the last ability triggers as the cost is paid, while the
 * mana ability itself resolves immediately without using the stack. That is what produces the
 * printed ordering the rulings call out: you choose the colours and get the mana first, and the
 * card is drawn afterwards when the trigger resolves.
 *
 * The trigger is `Triggers.self.dies()` — battlefield-to-graveyard on the source. It is not creature-only
 * despite the name, which is exactly the "no matter how it's put into a graveyard" the rulings want:
 * self-sacrifice, destruction and any other route to the graveyard all fire it.
