/**
 * Wings of Velis Vel
 * {1}{U}
 * Kindred Instant — Shapeshifter
 *
 * Changeling (This card is every creature type.)
 * Until end of turn, target creature has base power and toughness 4/4, gains all creature types,
 * and gains flying.
 *
 * "Base power and toughness 4/4" is a Layer 7b *set* — it overwrites the printed values but still
 * sits under any counters and pump the creature picks up afterwards, so `SetBasePowerAndToughness`
 * is the right primitive rather than a `ModifyStats` delta.
 *
 * "Gains all creature types" is modelled by granting Changeling — the engine expands that keyword
 * into every creature type (CR 702.73), the same way [BladesOfVelisVel] does.
 *
 * Note: "Tribal" was errata'd to "Kindred" in 2024.
