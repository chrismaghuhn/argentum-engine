/**
 * Hoofprints of the Stag
 * {1}{W}
 * Kindred Enchantment — Elemental
 * Whenever you draw a card, you may put a hoofprint counter on this enchantment.
 * {2}{W}, Remove four hoofprint counters from this enchantment: Create a 4/4 white Elemental
 * creature token with flying. Activate only during your turn.
 *
 * `hoofprint` is a passive counter type — no inherent rule, purely this card's own tally — named by
 * [CounterType.HOOFPRINT].
 *
 * Two details the wording forces:
 *
 * - The draw trigger fires **per card drawn** (2007-10-01 ruling), which is what
 *   `Triggers.you.draws()` already does — a "draw three cards" spell gives three separate triggers,
 *   each with its own "you may". [Effects.May] is that optionality; declining one doesn't decline
 *   the rest.
 * - "Activate only during your turn" is a timing restriction on the ability, not sorcery speed:
 *   [ActivationRestriction.OnlyDuringYourTurn] permits activation during your own upkeep or in
 *   response to a spell on your turn, which sorcery-speed timing would not.
 *
 * Being a Kindred Elemental with an activated ability, this enchantment is an *Elemental permanent*
 * for cards that count them — activating it triggers Ceaseless Searblades, while the creature-only
 * Incandescent Soulstoke lord does not pump it.
