/**
 * Ajani Goldmane - {2}{W}{W}
 * Legendary Planeswalker — Ajani
 * Starting Loyalty: 4
 *
 * +1: You gain 2 life.
 *
 * −1: Put a +1/+1 counter on each creature you control. Those creatures gain vigilance until
 * end of turn.
 *
 * −6: Create a white Avatar creature token. It has "This token's power and toughness are each
 * equal to your life total."
 *
 * The −1 fans out over the creatures you control at resolution, giving each its counter and its
 * vigilance in one pass — the 2007-10-01 ruling says the vigilance stays until end of turn even
 * if the counter is later removed, which the independent `GrantKeyword` floating effect honors.
 * The Avatar's P/T is a characteristic-defining ability, not a snapshot: it is modelled as a
 * [SetBasePowerToughnessDynamicStatic] on the token so it tracks your life total continuously
 * (the second 2007-10-01 ruling).
