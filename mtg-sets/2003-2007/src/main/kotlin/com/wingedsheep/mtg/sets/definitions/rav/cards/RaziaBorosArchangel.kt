/**
 * Razia, Boros Archangel — Ravnica: City of Guilds #223
 * {4}{R}{R}{W}{W} · Legendary Creature — Angel 6/3 · Rare
 *
 * Flying, vigilance, haste
 * {T}: The next 3 damage that would be dealt to target creature you control this turn is dealt
 * to another target creature instead.
 *
 * Modelling notes:
 * - A capacity-limited redirection shield (CR 615.7 / CR 614.9): `amount = 3` is what makes the
 *   two rulings fall out of the engine's own bookkeeping — the 3 damage need not come from one
 *   source or all at once, because the shield decrements per instance and survives until its
 *   capacity is spent.
 * - Two independent single-target requirements, the second wrapped in [TargetOther] so it cannot
 *   be the same creature as the first (CR 601.2c "another"). Both are creatures — the recipient
 *   may be any creature, including one Razia's controller owns.
 * - "If either target creature leaves the battlefield before damage is dealt, that damage won't
 *   be redirected": the protected creature leaving means nothing is dealt to it; the recipient
 *   leaving is handled by the redirection check, which skips a shield whose recipient is gone so
 *   the original creature takes the damage. Razia herself leaving doesn't matter — the shield is
 *   a floating effect, not a static of hers.
