 * Bogardan Rager

 * Creature — Elemental
 * 3/4
 * Flash (You may cast this spell any time you could cast an instant.)
 * When this creature enters, target creature gets +4/+0 until end of turn.
 *
 * Flash plus a pump-on-entry is the combat trick half of the card: cast it during combat and the
 * entry trigger can push an already-declared attacker or blocker over the top. The trigger targets
 * any creature, the Rager itself included.
