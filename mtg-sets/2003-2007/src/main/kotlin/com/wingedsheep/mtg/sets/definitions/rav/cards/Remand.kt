/**
 * Remand — Ravnica: City of Guilds #63 (canonical printing)
 * {1}{U} · Instant
 *
 * Counter target spell. If that spell is countered this way, put it into its owner's hand instead
 * of into that player's graveyard.
 * Draw a card.
 *
 * The "instead of into that player's graveyard" clause is a [CounterDestination], not a bounce.
 * That distinction is the whole card: `ReturnSpellToOwnersHandEffect` is explicitly *not* a counter,
 * so modelling Remand with it would let it "counter" an uncounterable spell and would stop every
 * "whenever a spell is countered" trigger from seeing it. Both rulings below fall out of routing
 * through the counter path instead — an uncounterable spell is neither countered nor returned (you
 * still draw), and a flashback card's own exile replacement still wins over the hand.
 *
 * The draw is a separate clause and happens regardless of what the counter did, so it sits beside
 * the counter in a [Effects.Composite] rather than inside it.
