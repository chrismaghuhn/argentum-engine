 * Conclave's Blessing

 * Enchantment — Aura
 *
 * Convoke
 * Enchant creature
 * Enchanted creature gets +0/+2 for each other creature you control.
 *
 * "Other" is measured against the *enchanted* creature, not against the Aura — and that is what
 * `excludeSelf` means here: [DynamicAmount.AggregateBattlefield] takes "self" to be the affected
 * entity when the aggregate is evaluated for a granted effect, which for an Aura's stat grant is
 * the creature it enchants. "You" stays the Aura's controller, so enchanting an opponent's
 * creature counts *your* creatures and excludes nothing (the host isn't among them).
