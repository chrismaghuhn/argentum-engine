/**
 * Grozoth
 * {6}{U}{U}{U}
 * Creature — Leviathan
 * 9/9
 * Defender
 * When this creature enters, you may search your library for any number of cards that have mana
 * value 9, reveal them, put them into your hand, then shuffle.
 * {4}: This creature loses defender until end of turn.
 * Transmute {1}{U}{U}
 *
 * The search is the ordinary library pipeline with an *unbounded* selection, so it is written
 * inline via `Effects.Pipeline` rather than `Patterns.Library.searchLibrary` (which only offers
 * `ChooseUpTo(count)`). The consent gate wraps the whole pipeline — declining skips the shuffle
 * too, the Goblin Matron rule — while `chooseAnyNumber` separately allows finding nothing.
 *
 * "Loses defender until end of turn" is [Effects.RemoveKeyword]'s default `Duration.EndOfTurn`, a
 * layer-6 removal; activating twice in a turn is redundant rather than cumulative.
 *
 * Grozoth's mana value is 9 and transmute searches for a card with the *discarded card's* mana
 * value, so both halves of this card fetch the same nine-drops — the printed joke.
