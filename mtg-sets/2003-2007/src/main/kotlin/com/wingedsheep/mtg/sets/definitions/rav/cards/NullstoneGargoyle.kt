/**
 * Nullstone Gargoyle — Ravnica: City of Guilds #266
 * {9} · Artifact Creature — Gargoyle · 4/5 · Rare
 *
 * Flying
 * Whenever the first noncreature spell of a turn is cast, counter that spell.
 *
 * "The first noncreature spell **of a turn**" is a per-turn count across every player, which is
 * why this is not `Triggers.player(…).castsNth(1)`: that event counts the *caster's* own history, so
 * the second player's first noncreature spell of the turn would also trigger it. Instead the
 * trigger is the plain "a player casts a noncreature spell" event with a `triggerRestriction`
 * that reads the whole table's cast history — `SpellsCastThisTurn(Player.Each, Noncreature)`
 * sums every player's records, and the triggering spell is already recorded when the event is
 * examined, so "equals 1" is exactly "this is the turn's first".
 *
 * The count is a `triggerRestriction`, not an intervening-"if": it qualifies the *event* (CR
 * 603.2) and is never re-checked on resolution, so a second noncreature spell cast in response
 * neither rescues the first nor gets countered itself — both 2005 rulings. And because the
 * history counts casts rather than resolutions, a noncreature spell cast before the Gargoyle
 * arrived still closes the window for the turn.
