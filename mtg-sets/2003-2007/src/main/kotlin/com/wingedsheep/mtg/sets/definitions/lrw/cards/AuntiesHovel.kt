/**
 * Auntie's Hovel
 * Land
 *
 * As this land enters, you may reveal a Goblin card from your hand.
 * If you don't, this land enters tapped.
 * {T}: Add {B} or {R}.
 *
 * One of Lorwyn's five "tribal reveal" duals. Same two atoms as Shadows over Innistrad's
 * shadowlands (see Game Trail):
 *  - [OnEnterRun] — the generic "as ~ enters, run [effect]" replacement wrapper.
 *  - [Effects.MayRevealCardFromHand] — an optional reveal whose `otherwise` rider fires when the
 *    player declines or holds no eligible card; here it taps the land.
 *
 * The only difference from the shadowlands is what the filter reads: a *creature type* on any card
 * type rather than a land subtype. [GameObjectFilter.Any] with a subtype predicate is what makes
 * that work — Lorwyn's Kindred cards (e.g. Crush Underfoot, a Kindred Instant — Giant) carry the
 * creature type without being creatures, and they count for the reveal.
