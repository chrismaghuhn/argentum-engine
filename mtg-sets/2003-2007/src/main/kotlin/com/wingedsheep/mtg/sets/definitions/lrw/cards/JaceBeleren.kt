/**
 * Jace Beleren - {1}{U}{U}
 * Legendary Planeswalker — Jace
 * Starting Loyalty: 3
 *
 * +2: Each player draws a card.
 *
 * −1: Target player draws a card.
 *
 * −10: Target player mills twenty cards.
 *
 * The +2 is symmetric — Jace's controller draws too — so it is a draw aimed at [Player.Each], not
 * at each opponent. The −1 and −10 both target a *player*, which is what lets the −1 be pointed
 * at yourself and the −10 at an opponent whose library is short (they simply mill what's left,
 * per the 2009-10-01 ruling).
