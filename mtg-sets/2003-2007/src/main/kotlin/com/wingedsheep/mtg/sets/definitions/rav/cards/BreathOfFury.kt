/**
 * Breath of Fury
 * {2}{R}{R}
 * Enchantment — Aura
 * Enchant creature you control
 * When enchanted creature deals combat damage to a player, sacrifice it and attach this Aura to a
 * creature you control. If you do, untap all creatures you control and after this phase, there is
 * an additional combat phase.
 *
 * The re-attach is a resolution-time *choice*, not a target — so it is a gather over the creatures
 * you control followed by a `chooseExactly(1)`, not a `target()` handle. Gathering *after* the
 * sacrifice is what makes the sacrificed host ineligible without an explicit exclusion, and
 * `ChooseExactly`'s clamp is the 2005-10-01 ruling: with no legal creature left the selection is
 * empty, `ifNotEmpty` skips the payoff, and the now-unattached Aura is put into its owner's
 * graveyard by the unattached-Auras state-based action (never mid-resolution, so the attach above
 * still lands while the Aura is host-less).
