/**
 * Seed Spark — Ravnica: City of Guilds #30
 * {3}{W} · Instant
 *
 * Destroy target artifact or enchantment. If {G} was spent to cast this spell, create two 1/1 green
 * Saproling creature tokens.
 *
 * The Selesnya half of Ravnica's "if {X} was spent" rider cycle. The green clause asks only what was
 * *paid*, so any source of {G} — a Forest, a Temple Garden, Birds of Paradise — turns the Saprolings
 * on; it is not a second colour requirement on the spell, which stays mono-white.
 *
 * The rider is a plain `Effects.If` **after** the destruction rather than a branch around it,
 * because the two halves are independent: the tokens arrive even when the destroy half does nothing
 * (a target that regenerated or is indestructible), and the spell fizzles entirely — tokens included
 * — only when its single target is illegal on resolution (CR 608.2b).
 *
 * Note the earliest printing: Scryfall lists a `psal` (Salvat 2005) box printing three weeks before
 * Ravnica, but that is not a real expansion, so the canonical definition belongs here.
