/**
 * Thoughtseize
 * {B}
 * Sorcery
 *
 * Target player reveals their hand. You choose a nonland card from it. That player discards that
 * card. You lose 2 life.
 *
 * The hand-strip half is Duress's shape exactly — reveal, gather the target's hand, the *caster*
 * picks one, move it with [MoveType.Discard] so discard triggers see a real discard rather than a
 * bare zone change. Two things differ from Duress and both matter:
 *
 *  - it targets any **player**, not just an opponent, so [Targets.Player] rather than TargetOpponent;
 *  - the filter is `Nonland` only, so creatures are fair game.
 *
 * The life loss is a separate clause and is unconditional: per the 2020-08-07 ruling you lose 2
 * even when the target's hand holds nothing to take, which is why it sits outside the
 * gather/select/move chain rather than riding on the discard.
