/**
 * Incendiary Command
 * {3}{R}{R}
 * Sorcery
 * Choose two —
 * • Incendiary Command deals 4 damage to target player or planeswalker.
 * • Incendiary Command deals 2 damage to each creature.
 * • Destroy target nonbasic land.
 * • Each player discards all the cards in their hand, then draws that many cards.
 *
 * The red member of the Lorwyn Command cycle. The wheel mode is the only one worth a note: it is
 * **per player**, not a shared count, so it runs inside a [ForEachPlayerEffect] over
 * [Player.Each]. That rebinds `controllerId` per iteration and — crucially — gives each iteration
 * fresh stored collections, so the `discardedHand_count` that
 * [Patterns.Hand.discardHand] publishes is that player's own hand size. Hoisting the discard out
 * of the loop would draw everyone the same number of cards.
