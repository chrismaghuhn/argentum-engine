/**
 * Horde of Notions
 * {W}{U}{B}{R}{G}
 * Legendary Creature — Elemental
 * 5/5
 *
 * Vigilance, trample, haste
 * {W}{U}{B}{R}{G}: You may play target Elemental card from your graveyard without paying its
 * mana cost.
 *
 * "Elemental card" is the bare tribal noun, so the target is any card with the subtype — a Kindred
 * noncreature Elemental such as Hoofprints of the Stag qualifies, and narrowing to
 * `CreatureInYourGraveyard` would silently drop it. Ownership, not control, is the axis for a card
 * sitting in a graveyard.
 *
 * The free cast is [GrantFreeCastTargetFromExileEffect] despite its name: the executor is
 * zone-agnostic — it stamps `PlayWithoutPayingCostComponent` on the target and registers a
 * `MayPlayPermission` wherever the card is — and `CastFromZoneEnumerator` already scans graveyards
 * alongside exile for such permissions (the path Malcolm, Alluring Scoundrel opened). So no exile
 * detour and no graveyard sibling effect is needed.
 *
 * The 2007-10-01 ruling that this doesn't let you pay an evoke cost falls out for free: the
 * permission is "without paying its mana cost", and an alternative cost is never offered on top
 * of it.
