/**
 * Isochron Scepter
 * {2}
 * Artifact
 *
 * Imprint — When this artifact enters, you may exile an instant card with mana value 2 or less
 * from your hand.
 * {2}, {T}: You may copy the exiled card. If you do, you may cast the copy without paying its
 * mana cost.
 *
 * The imprint is the Chrome Mox shape: a linked exile (`linkToSource = true`) from your own hand,
 * with no reveal — only the exiled card becomes public. Because the pile is linked to the Scepter,
 * the activated ability re-reads it live: if the imprinted card leaves exile the gather comes back
 * empty and nothing is copied, matching the ruling that the copy can't be made once the card has
 * left the exile zone.
 *
 * The printed text carries two "may"s — copy, then cast. They collapse into the single prompt here
 * because declining the second one is indistinguishable from declining the first: a copy that is
 * never cast is a card-shaped object in exile that the next state-based-action check removes, and
 * nothing in the rules triggers on a card in exile being copied. The prompt therefore covers the
 * whole copy-and-cast, which is the only branch with an observable outcome.
