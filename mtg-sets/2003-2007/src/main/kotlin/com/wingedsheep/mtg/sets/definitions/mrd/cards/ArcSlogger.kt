/**
 * Arc-Slogger — Mirrodin #85 (canonical printing)
 * {3}{R}{R} · Creature — Beast · 4/5
 *
 * {R}, Exile the top ten cards of your library: This creature deals 2 damage to any target.
 *
 * The whole card is its cost. Ten cards off the top is a *cost*, not an effect, and the difference
 * is the one thing an implementation can get wrong: CR 118.3 says a player can't pay a cost without
 * the resources to pay it fully, so a nine-card library can't activate this at all — it does not
 * exile nine and fire. [Costs.ExileTopOfLibrary] carries that gate, which is also why it isn't
 * [Costs.Mill] with the destination swapped: the cards go to exile, and no mill replacement
 * (Bruvac) touches the count.
 *
 * The cards are the top ten, not ten of the player's choosing, so the payment takes no selection —
 * the same shape as milling as a cost.
