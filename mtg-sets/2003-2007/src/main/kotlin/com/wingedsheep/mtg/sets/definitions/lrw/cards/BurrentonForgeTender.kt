/**
 * Burrenton Forge-Tender
 * {W}
 * Creature — Kithkin Wizard
 * 1/1
 * Protection from red
 * Sacrifice this creature: Prevent all damage a red source of your choice would deal this turn.
 *
 * Modelling notes:
 * - The prevention has **no recipient clause** — it stops the chosen source's damage to anything,
 *   not just to its controller. That is `direction = FromTarget` over a chosen source, the same
 *   shield Mourner's Shield installs.
 * - **The ability doesn't target** (2017-11-17 ruling): the source is chosen as the ability
 *   resolves, and the ability can be activated with no red source on the board at all. A
 *   `Chosen` eligibility filter is a choice restriction, not a target requirement, so
 *   that falls out for free.
 * - `nextInstanceOnly` stays false — this is an all-damage-for-the-turn shield, not a Circle of
 *   Protection's single instance.
