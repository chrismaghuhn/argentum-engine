/**
 * Worldslayer — Mirrodin #276 (canonical printing; reprinted in M12)
 * {5} · Artifact — Equipment
 *
 * Whenever equipped creature deals combat damage to a player, destroy all permanents other than this
 * Equipment.
 * Equip {5}
 *
 * Same trigger shape as [MaskOfMemory] — combat damage to a player, [TriggerBinding.ATTACHED] so it
 * reads the equipped creature rather than the Equipment itself.
 *
 * "All permanents other than this Equipment" is a single [Effects.DestroyAll] over
 * `GameObjectFilter.Permanent.notSourceItself()`; the source-relative exclusion is what keeps
 * Worldslayer on the battlefield to be equipped again. Nothing else is spared — the 2011-09-22
 * ruling ("The equipped creature is also destroyed") falls straight out of the filter rather than
 * needing a carve-out, and lands go with everything else.
