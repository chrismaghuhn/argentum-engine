/**
 * Golgari Grave-Troll
 * {4}{G}
 * Creature — Troll Skeleton
 * 0/0
 * This creature enters with a +1/+1 counter on it for each creature card in your graveyard.
 * {1}, Remove a +1/+1 counter from this creature: Regenerate this creature.
 * Dredge 6
 *
 * A 0/0 whose whole body is the graveyard it came out of. The three lines compose without new
 * vocabulary: [EntersWithDynamicCounters] over a `Count(You, GRAVEYARD, Creature)` for the entry,
 * the existing `RemoveCounterFromSelf` cost atom plus `Effects.Regenerate` for the shield, and
 * [KeywordAbility.dredge] for the recursion.
 *
 * The counter count is taken as the Troll enters, so a Grave-Troll returned *from* the graveyard
 * straight to the battlefield still counts itself — it hasn't left the graveyard when the
 * as-enters replacement measures (per the 2018 ruling below).
 *
 * The regeneration shield is bought with the Troll's own body: each activation shrinks it by one,
 * so damage already marked on it can turn lethal the moment a counter comes off, killing it before
 * the activated ability it paid for ever resolves.
