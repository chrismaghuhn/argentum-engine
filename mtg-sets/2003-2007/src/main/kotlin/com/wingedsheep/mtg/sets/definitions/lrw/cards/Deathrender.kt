/**
 * Deathrender — Lorwyn #255
 * {4} · Artifact — Equipment
 *
 * Equipped creature gets +2/+2.
 * Whenever equipped creature dies, you may put a creature card from your hand onto the
 * battlefield and attach this Equipment to it.
 * Equip {2}
 *
 * The trigger is Forebear's Blade's — a battlefield-leave to the graveyard bound with
 * [TriggerBinding.ATTACHED], so it reads the creature the Equipment was on rather than the
 * Equipment itself. Deathrender is still attached at the moment its host dies, which is what the
 * binding needs; the state-based unattach happens afterwards.
 *
 * The cheat-into-play half is the [Patterns.Hand.putFromHand] pipeline (Incandescent Soulstoke,
 * Through the Breach), where the `ChooseUpTo(1)` selection *is* the printed "you may" — a player
 * who declines simply selects nothing. The attach then runs under
 * [ConditionalOnCollectionEffect] so an empty selection doesn't reach it, and names the moved
 * card through `PipelineTarget("putting", 0)` — the collection carries the card's id across the
 * hand-to-battlefield move, so the attach lands on the permanent that just entered.
 *
 * The ruling about a creature that can't be equipped (protection from artifacts) needs no
 * card-level guard: [Effects.AttachEquipment] refuses an illegal host, so the creature enters and
 * Deathrender stays where it is.
