/**
 * Shields of Velis Vel
 * {W}
 * Kindred Instant — Shapeshifter
 *
 * Changeling (This card is every creature type.)
 * Creatures target player controls get +0/+1 and gain all creature types until end of turn.
 *
 * The toughness-side twin of Ego Erasure, and built the same way: the player is the only
 * *target*, and the creatures are a group resolved on resolution, so `targetPlayerControls`
 * binds the group's controller predicate to that target rather than to the spell's controller.
 * Both riders land on each member with [EffectTarget.IterationEntity] inside the iteration, so a creature
 * that leaves mid-resolution simply drops out.
 *
 * "Gains all creature types" is modelled by granting Changeling — the engine expands that
 * keyword into every creature type (CR 702.73), the same shape Blades of Velis Vel uses.
 *
 * Note: "Tribal" was errata'd to "Kindred" in 2024.
