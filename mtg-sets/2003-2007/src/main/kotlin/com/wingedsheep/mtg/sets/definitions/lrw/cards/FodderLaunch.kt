/**
 * Fodder Launch
 * {3}{B}
 * Kindred Sorcery — Goblin
 *
 * As an additional cost to cast this spell, sacrifice a Goblin.
 * Target creature gets -5/-5 until end of turn. Fodder Launch deals 5 damage to that creature's
 * controller.
 *
 * The Goblin is sacrificed on announcement (an additional cost, so it happens whether or not the
 * spell resolves), which is also what makes this the sacrifice outlet half of the Boggart deck.
 *
 * "That creature's controller" is [EffectTarget.TargetController] — read from the *target* rather
 * than from the spell's controller, so the damage follows a creature that changed hands.
 *
 * Note: "Tribal" was errata'd to "Kindred" in 2024.
