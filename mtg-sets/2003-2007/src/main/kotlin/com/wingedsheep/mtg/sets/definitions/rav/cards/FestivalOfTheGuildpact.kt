/**
 * Festival of the Guildpact
 * {X}{W}
 * Instant
 *
 * Prevent the next X damage that would be dealt to you this turn.
 * Draw a card.
 *
 * The shield is untargeted and always protects the caster, so the prevention takes
 * [EffectTarget.Controller] rather than a chosen target. X is the value announced as the spell was
 * cast, read at resolution by [DynamicAmount.XValue].
 *
 * Both halves happen on resolution, in printed order: per the ruling the card is drawn when the
 * spell resolves, not later when damage is actually prevented, so this is a plain sequence and not
 * a rider on the shield.
