/**
 * Fathom Trawl
 * {3}{U}{U}
 * Sorcery
 * Reveal cards from the top of your library until you reveal three nonland cards. Put the nonland
 * cards revealed this way into your hand, then put the rest of the revealed cards on the bottom of
 * your library in any order.
 *
 * `Patterns.Library.revealUntilMatchToHand` at `count = 3`: the gather stops once three nonland
 * cards have been revealed, then the same nonland partition splits the revealed pile — matches to
 * hand, the lands revealed alongside them to the bottom. "In any order" is
 * [CardOrder.ControllerChooses], not the pattern's default random order.
 *
 * The 2007-10-01 ruling — fewer than three nonland cards in the library reveals the whole library,
 * takes every nonland card, and bottoms the rest — is the gather's own empty-library behaviour, not
 * a separate branch.
