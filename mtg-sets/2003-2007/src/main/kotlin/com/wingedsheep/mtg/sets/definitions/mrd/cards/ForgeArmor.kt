/**
 * Forge Armor — Mirrodin #92
 * {4}{R} · Instant
 *
 * As an additional cost to cast this spell, sacrifice an artifact.
 * Put X +1/+1 counters on target creature, where X is the sacrificed artifact's mana value.
 *
 * The spell-side twin of Bosh, Iron Golem, composed the same way as Eldritch Evolution: the
 * additional cost binds the sacrificed artifact to [EffectTarget.SacrificedAsCost] at cost payment,
 * and the counter count reads [EntityNumericProperty.ManaValue] off that snapshot at resolution —
 * mana value is a printed characteristic, so it still reads correctly from the graveyard.
 *
 * The additional cost is paid at cast time (CR 601.2h), so an artifact sacrificed to it is gone
 * before the spell resolves; sacrificing a {0} artifact is legal and simply puts no counters on
 * the target. An {X} artifact on the battlefield has X = 0 (CR 202.3b).
