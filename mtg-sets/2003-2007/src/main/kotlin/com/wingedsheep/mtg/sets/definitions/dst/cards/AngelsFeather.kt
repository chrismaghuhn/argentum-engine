/**
 * Angel's Feather
 * {2}
 * Artifact
 *
 * Whenever a player casts a white spell, you may gain 1 life.
 *
 * One of Darksteel's five "Feather/Horn/Claw/Eye/Tooth" artifacts — a single shape with the spell
 * filter recoloured. "A player" is every player, this artifact's controller included, so the trigger
 * is `Triggers.anyPlayer.casts(spell, requires)` (binding ANY, `Player.Each`). The filter is colour-based rather than
 * type-based: any white spell qualifies, a partly-white multicoloured spell included. The printed
 * "you may" is the builder's `optional = true`, which lowers to a `Gate.MayDecide` around the life
 * gain; the artifact's controller is always the one who decides and gains, whoever cast the spell.
