 *
 * Search your library for up to three Aura cards with different names, reveal them, put them
 * into your hand, then shuffle.
 *
 * The Reach the Horizon pipeline with a different filter and cap: gather the library's Auras →
 * `ChooseUpTo(3)` under [SelectionRestriction.OnePerCardName] ("with different names") → move to
 * hand revealed → shuffle. "Up to three" means finding fewer — or none — is legal, so the
 * selection never forces a pick.
