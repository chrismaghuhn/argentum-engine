/**
 * Inner-Flame Igniter — Lorwyn #182
 * {2}{R} · Creature — Elemental Warrior · 2/2
 *
 * {2}{R}: Creatures you control get +1/+0 until end of turn. If this is the third time this
 * ability has resolved this turn, creatures you control gain first strike until end of turn.
 *
 * The Harvestrite Host shape: [IncrementAbilityResolutionCountEffect] bumps the source's
 * per-turn resolution tally, then [Conditions.SourceAbilityResolvedNTimes] reads it back. The
 * increment must sit *between* the two clauses — the condition compares against the count
 * including this resolution, so a bump after the check would fire the bonus on the fourth
 * activation instead of the third. The ruling that only the *third* resolution pays out is
 * therefore free: the condition is an equality, not a threshold.
 *
 * Two separate group passes, not [Patterns.Group.pumpAndGrantToAll]: the printed text names
 * "creatures you control" twice, in two clauses that fire independently — the pump every time,
 * the first strike only on the third. Overrun's single-pass form would bind the group once and
 * grant unconditionally.
 *
 * The tally counts *resolutions*, which is what the effect being composed into the ability's
 * own resolution gives us for free — an activation still on the stack, or one countered, never
 * reaches the increment.
