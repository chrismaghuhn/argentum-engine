/**
 * Helldozer
 * {3}{B}{B}{B}
 * Creature — Zombie Giant
 * 6/5
 *
 * {B}{B}{B}, {T}: Destroy target land. If that land was nonbasic, untap this creature.
 *
 * Same ordering as Molten Rain and Choking Sands: run the conditional rider while the target is
 * still on the battlefield, then destroy. The condition reads the target's *current* nonbasic
 * status, which is what the past-tense oracle phrasing ("if that land **was** nonbasic") means —
 * after the move the target no longer names a battlefield permanent, so a check on the far side
 * would silently answer "no" and the untap would never fire.
 *
 * The rider is an untap, not damage, and that is what makes the ability repeatable within a turn:
 * untapping refunds the {T} in the cost, so with enough black mana Helldozer eats every nonbasic
 * land on the board. Note the ability says "was nonbasic", not "was destroyed" — a nonbasic land
 * that regenerates or is indestructible still untaps Helldozer, which this ordering gets right for
 * free.
