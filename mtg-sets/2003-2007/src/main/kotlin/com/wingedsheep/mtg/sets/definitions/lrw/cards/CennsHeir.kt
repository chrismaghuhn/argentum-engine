/**
 * Cenn's Heir
 * {1}{W}
 * Creature — Kithkin Soldier
 * 1/1
 * Whenever this creature attacks, it gets +1/+1 until end of turn for each other attacking Kithkin.
 *
 * The printed count has no controller clause, so it is [Player.Each] rather than the more common
 * `Player.You` — in a multiplayer attack a teammate's Kithkin counts too. "Other" is the aggregate's
 * own `excludeSelf`, not a subtract-one, so the count stays right even in the corner where the source
 * has stopped being a Kithkin by the time the trigger resolves.
