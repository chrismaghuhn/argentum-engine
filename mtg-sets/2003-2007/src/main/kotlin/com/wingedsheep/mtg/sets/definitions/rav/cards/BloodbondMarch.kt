/**
 * Bloodbond March — Ravnica: City of Guilds #192
 * {2}{B}{G} · Enchantment · Rare
 *
 * Whenever a player casts a creature spell, each player returns all cards with the same name as
 * that spell from their graveyard to the battlefield.
 *
 * Modelling notes:
 * - The trigger is ANY-bound on every player's creature spells, so the spell on the stack is the
 *   triggering entity and "the same name as that spell" is
 *   `sharingNameWith(EffectTarget.TriggeringEntity)` — the filter Spellweaver Helix reads against
 *   its imprint pile, here read against every graveyard at once via `Player.Each`.
 * - The spell itself is on the stack, not in a graveyard, so it is never among the gathered
 *   cards; the trigger resolves before the spell does, which is why the freshly cast creature
 *   does not return itself.
 * - "Each player returns … from their graveyard" is one gather across every graveyard and one
 *   move with `underOwnersControl`, so each returned card comes back under its own owner's
 *   control — including the caster's opponents' copies. Nothing is chosen and nothing is tapped.
