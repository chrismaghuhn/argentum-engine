/**
 * Gaze of the Gorgon — Ravnica: City of Guilds #246
 * {3}{B/G} · Instant
 *
 * Regenerate target creature. At this turn's next end of combat, destroy all creatures that
 * blocked or were blocked by it this turn.
 *
 * The regeneration is the ordinary shield. The second sentence is a step-based delayed trigger at
 * [Step.END_COMBAT] with [DelayedTriggerTiming.THIS_TURN_ONLY] — "this turn's *next* end of
 * combat", so cast after the last combat of the turn it is simply dropped at end of turn. Its
 * `watchedTarget` bakes in the targeted creature, which the fired trigger exposes as its triggering
 * entity; the destroy filter then reads every creature's turn-scoped combat-partner record for it
 * ([GameObjectFilter.blockedOrWasBlockedByThisTurn] over [EffectTarget.TriggeringEntity]). That record
 * is written at block declaration on both sides and kept until the turn ends, so — per the ruling —
 * creatures that blocked it before the Gaze was cast are included, and it does not matter whether
 * the targeted creature is still on the battlefield when the trigger resolves.
