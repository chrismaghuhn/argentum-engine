/**
 * Verifies CR 302.6: a creature can't attack (or use tap/untap activated abilities)
 * unless it has been under its controller's control continuously since their most
 * recent turn began. Any change of control breaks that chain, so the engine must
 * stamp a new SummoningSicknessComponent onto the permanent on every transfer.
 *
 * This covers all five control-change executors:
 *   - GainControlExecutor (Blatant Thievery)
 *   - GainControlByActivePlayerExecutor       (covered indirectly — same fix shape)
 *   - GainControlByMostExecutor               (covered indirectly — same fix shape)
 *   - GiveControlToTargetPlayerExecutor (Custody Battle suffer branch)
 *   - ExchangeControlExecutor (Exchange Ritual — minimal sorcery wrapper)
