 * Creature — Kavu
 * 2/2
 * {T}: Target land becomes a Swamp until end of turn.
 *
 * "Becomes" replaces the land's existing land subtypes (Rule 305.7), so the land loses
 * the mana abilities of its old types and gains Swamp's — modeled with
 * [Effects.SetLandType] rather than the additive [Effects.AddSubtype]. Same shape as
 * Dream Thrush, but with a fixed type instead of a player choice.
