/**
 * Protective Sphere
 * {2}{W}
 * Enchantment
 * {1}, Pay 1 life: Prevent all damage that would be dealt to you this turn by a source of
 * your choice that shares a color with the mana spent on this activation cost. (Colorless mana
 * prevents no damage.)
 *
 * Modeling note: rather than tracking the color of the single generic mana spent on the cost,
 * the "shares a color with the mana spent" restriction is captured by only offering colored
 * sources for the choice (a `PreventionSourceFilter.Chosen` over `CardPredicate.IsColored`). A colorless source
 * shares a color with no mana, so it can never be chosen — which is exactly what the reminder
 * text means by "colorless mana prevents no damage." The player picks the colored source they
 * want to stop (paying mana of a matching color, as the rules require).
