/**
 * Probe
 * {2}{U}
 * Sorcery
 * Kicker {1}{B}
 * Draw three cards, then discard two cards. If this spell was kicked, target player
 * discards two cards.
 *
 * The target player is only relevant when the spell is kicked, so it is declared as an
 * optional target (minCount 0). When unkicked, no target need be chosen; the kicked
 * discard simply never resolves.
 *
 * Approximation: strictly, a *kicked* Probe requires a target player. Kicker is chosen
 * while casting (CR 601.2b) and targets are then announced (CR 601.2c), so the targeted
 * clause is only mandatory once the spell is kicked. The SDK has no kicker-conditional
 * target requirement, so a kicked cast could legally be made with no target — in which
 * case the discard fizzles. A dedicated card-specific primitive isn't worth it for one
 * card; if a second kicked-only-target card appears, add a general "required-iff-kicked"
 * target flag.
