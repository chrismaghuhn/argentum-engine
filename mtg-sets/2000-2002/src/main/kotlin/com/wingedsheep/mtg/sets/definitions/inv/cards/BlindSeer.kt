/**
 * Blind Seer
 * {2}{U}{U}
 * Legendary Creature — Human Wizard
 * 3/3
 * {1}{U}: Target spell or permanent becomes the color of your choice until end of turn.
 *
 * Invasion engine gap #11: first card to recolor a spell on the stack. The target uses
 * [TargetSpellOrPermanent] (battlefield permanent or stack spell); the color choice is the
 * existing single-color [Effects.ChooseColorThen] pattern, and [Effects.ChangeColorToChosen]
 * applies a Layer-5 color change that the projector now reads for stack objects too (so a
 * recolored spell's new color drives color-matching checks like protection during resolution).
