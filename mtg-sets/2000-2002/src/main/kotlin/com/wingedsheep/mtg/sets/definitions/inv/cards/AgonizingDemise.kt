/**
 * Agonizing Demise
 * {3}{B}
 * Instant
 * Kicker {1}{R}
 *
 * Destroy target nonblack creature. It can't be regenerated. If this spell was kicked,
 * Agonizing Demise deals damage equal to that creature's power to the creature's controller.
 *
 * The kicked damage is dealt before the creature is destroyed so its power (including counters and
 * continuous effects) is read while it is still on the battlefield — the engine has no last-known
 * power fallback for a spell's target once it leaves play, so off-battlefield it would read printed
 * power instead. Dealing the damage first yields the rules-correct (last-known) amount.
