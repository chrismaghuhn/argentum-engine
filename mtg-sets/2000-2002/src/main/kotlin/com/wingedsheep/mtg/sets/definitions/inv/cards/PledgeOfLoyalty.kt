/**
 * Pledge of Loyalty
 * {1}{W}
 * Enchantment — Aura
 * Enchant creature
 * Enchanted creature has protection from the colors of permanents you control. This effect doesn't
 * remove this Aura.
 *
 * The protection set is board-derived: [GrantProtectionFromControlledColors] reads the projected
 * colors of every permanent the Aura's controller controls (after Layer 5) and grants the enchanted
 * creature protection from each. Because the white Aura is itself a permanent you control, the
 * enchanted creature gains protection from white — the printed "This effect doesn't remove this
 * Aura" clause is a no-op in this engine, which never detaches an Aura for protection (704.5n only
 * detaches Auras whose object is gone or that are unattached).
