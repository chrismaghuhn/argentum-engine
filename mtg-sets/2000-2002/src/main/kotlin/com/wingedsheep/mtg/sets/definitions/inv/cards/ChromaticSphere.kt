/**
 * Chromatic Sphere

 * Artifact
 *
 * {1}, {T}, Sacrifice this artifact: Add one mana of any color. Draw a card.
 *
 * Not a mana ability. CR 605.1a (August 7, 2026) added "and its cost and effect don't move any card
 * to or from a library" to the criteria, and the draw is exactly that — so this is an ordinary
 * activated ability: it uses the stack, can be countered or responded to, and can't be activated
 * while paying a cost. The 2008 ruling below describes the pre-update classification and is kept
 * because it is what Scryfall still carries; it no longer describes how the card plays.
