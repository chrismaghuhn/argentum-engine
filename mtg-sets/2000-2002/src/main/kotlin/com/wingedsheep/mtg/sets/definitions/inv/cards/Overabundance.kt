/**
 * Overabundance
 * {1}{R}{G}
 * Enchantment
 * Whenever a player taps a land for mana, that player adds one mana of any type that land produced,
 * and this enchantment deals 1 damage to the player.
 *
 * Invasion engine gap #3. Built from the existing [AdditionalManaOnSourceTap] tap-bonus static:
 * `color = null` mirrors the produced mana ("any type that land produced"), and the new `rider`
 * resolves the "deals 1 damage to the player" clause inline (controlled by the tapping player, so
 * `EffectTarget.Controller` is the tapper and `EffectTarget.Self` is this enchantment).
 *
 * Like all mana-ability side effects in the engine, the mirror mana and the damage apply when a
 * player manually taps a land; automatic cost payment adds the mirror mana via the mana solver but
 * skips the damage rider (the same limitation that applies to e.g. City of Brass during auto-pay).
