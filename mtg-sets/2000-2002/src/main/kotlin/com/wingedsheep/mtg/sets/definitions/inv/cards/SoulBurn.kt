/**
 * Soul Burn
 * {X}{2}{B}
 * Sorcery
 * Spend only black and/or red mana on X.
 * Soul Burn deals X damage to any target. You gain life equal to the amount of black
 * mana spent this way.
 *
 * The `xManaRestriction` limits the `{X}` portion to black/red mana, and
 * [DynamicAmount.ManaSpentOnX] reads how much of that was black to size the life gain.
 *
 * Note: this implements the original Invasion wording (life gained = black mana spent on
 * X). The current Oracle text additionally caps the life gain at the actual damage dealt /
 * the target's life total / loyalty / toughness; those secondary caps are omitted as they
 * only differ in edge cases where the target survives with fewer hit points than X.
