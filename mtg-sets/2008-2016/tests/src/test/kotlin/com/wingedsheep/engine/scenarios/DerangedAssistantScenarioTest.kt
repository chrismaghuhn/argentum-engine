/**
 * Deranged Assistant (ISD #52) — {1}{U} 1/1 Human Wizard, "{T}, Mill a card: Add {C}."
 *
 * Covers the `CostAtom.Mill` cost vocabulary this card introduced:
 * - payment mills the top card and the ability then produces {C} (happy path),
 * - CR 701.17b — the ability is surfaced as unaffordable on an empty library and submitting it
 *   anyway is rejected, rather than silently producing free mana,
 * - the mill is a *cost*, so the card is already in the graveyard by the time the mana exists.
 *
 * **This is not a mana ability.** CR 605.1a gained "and its cost and effect don't move any card to
 * or from a library" on August 7, 2026, and the mill cost is exactly that, so the ability uses the
 * stack like any other. The split that buys — cost paid at activation, mana only at resolution — is
 * asserted below, because it is the entire observable difference and nothing on the printed card
 * says which side of it this ability falls on.
