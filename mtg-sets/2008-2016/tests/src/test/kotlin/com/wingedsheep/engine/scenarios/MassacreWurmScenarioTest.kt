/**
 * Massacre Wurm (MBS #46) — {3}{B}{B}{B} Creature — Phyrexian Wurm 6/5.
 *
 *   When this creature enters, creatures your opponents control get -2/-2 until end of turn.
 *   Whenever a creature an opponent controls dies, that player loses 2 life.
 *
 * Exercises the enters group debuff (per-creature -2/-2 over opponents' creatures), the
 * death-drain trigger (including when the debuff itself kills the creature), that "that player"
 * resolves to the dead creature's controller, and that your own creatures don't drain you.
