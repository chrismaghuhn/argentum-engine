/**
 * Riot Ringleader
 * {2}{R}
 * Creature — Human Warrior
 * 2 / 2
 *
 * Whenever this creature attacks, Human creatures you control get +1/+0 until end of turn.
 *
 * `Triggers.self.attacks()` is SELF-bound, so only the Ringleader's own attack fires it. The pump is
 * [Patterns.Group.modifyStatsForAll] over the Humans you control — a group iteration rather than a
 * static lord, so the bonus is locked to the creatures present on resolution and expires at end of
 * turn. The Ringleader is itself a Human, so it pumps too.
