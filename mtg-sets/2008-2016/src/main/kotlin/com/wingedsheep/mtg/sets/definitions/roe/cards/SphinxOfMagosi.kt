/**
 * Sphinx of Magosi
 * {3}{U}{U}{U}
 * Creature — Sphinx
 * 6 / 6
 *
 * Flying
 * {2}{U}: Draw a card, then put a +1/+1 counter on this creature.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *  - The ability is a plain [activatedAbility] with only a mana cost — no `{T}`, no timing
 *    restriction — so it is repeatable at instant speed for as much mana as is available. That is
 *    Assay's single `CostAtomWrapper` → `AtomMana("{2}{U}")`.
 *  - "Draw a card, **then** put a +1/+1 counter on this creature" is one effect with an ordered
 *    pair of steps, not two abilities: [Effects.Composite] in the printed order, mirroring Assay's
 *    `Composite` of `DrawCards` then `AddCounters`. The order is load-bearing — the card is drawn
 *    before the counter goes on, so a replacement that stops the draw does not stop the counter.
 *  - The counter goes on the Sphinx itself, so the target is [EffectTarget.Self] (Assay's
 *    `"target": {"type": "Self"}`), not a chosen target.
