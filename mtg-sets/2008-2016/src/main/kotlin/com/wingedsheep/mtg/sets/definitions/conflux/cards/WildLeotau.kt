 * At the beginning of your upkeep, sacrifice this creature unless you pay {G}.
 *
 * `Triggers.you.beginningOf(Step.UPKEEP)` is `StepEvent(UPKEEP, You)` bound `ANY`. The "unless" is a **cost paid on
 * resolution**, not a may-gate: [PayOrSufferEffect] pairs [Costs.pay.Mana] with
 * [SacrificeSelfEffect], so declining — or being unable to pay — sacrifices the creature.
