/**
 * Lone Missionary
 * {1}{W}
 * Creature — Kor Monk
 * 2 / 1
 *
 * When this creature enters, you gain 4 life.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *  - "**When** this creature enters" is the one-shot `Triggers.self.enters()`; there is no
 *    "whenever" and no other-permanent watcher to model.
 *  - "**You** gain 4 life" is [Effects.GainLife]'s default recipient (`EffectTarget.Controller`),
 *    so the target argument is left off — writing it explicitly would restate a default.
