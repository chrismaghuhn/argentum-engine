/**
 * Knight-Captain of Eos
 * {4}{W}
 * Creature — Human Knight
 * 2 / 2
 * When this creature enters, create two 1/1 white Soldier creature tokens.
 * {W}, Sacrifice a Soldier: Prevent all combat damage that would be dealt this turn.
 *
 * The entry trigger is `Triggers.self.enters()` with a single [Effects.CreateToken] carrying
 * `count = 2` — one effect making two tokens, not two effects. The fog is the tokens' payoff: "a
 * Soldier" is a bare tribal noun, so the sacrifice cost filters *permanents* with the subtype
 * (`GameObjectFilter.Permanent.withSubtype`) rather than creatures, and the Knight-Captain's own
 * Soldiers pay for it. [Effects.PreventAllCombatDamage] is the un-targeted, board-wide shield —
 * `PreventionScope.CombatOnly` for the turn, both players' creatures alike.
