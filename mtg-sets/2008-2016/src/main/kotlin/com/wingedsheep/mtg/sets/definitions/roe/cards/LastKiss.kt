/**
 * Last Kiss
 * {2}{B}
 * Instant
 *
 * Last Kiss deals 2 damage to target creature and you gain 2 life.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *  - Assay compiles the sentence as a `Composite` of `DealDamage` then `GainLife`, which is the
 *    `.then(...)` chain below. The order matters: both halves happen on resolution, and the damage
 *    is dealt first, so the life gain is unconditional even if the damage is prevented or the
 *    creature survives.
 *  - The life gain has no target of its own — Assay emits a bare `GainLife`, and
 *    `EffectTarget.Controller` is already [Effects.GainLife]'s default, so it is left unwritten
 *    rather than restated.
