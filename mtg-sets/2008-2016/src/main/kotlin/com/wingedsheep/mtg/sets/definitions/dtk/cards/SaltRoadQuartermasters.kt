/**
 * Salt Road Quartermasters
 * {2}{G}
 * Creature — Human Soldier
 * 1 / 1
 *
 * This creature enters with two +1/+1 counters on it.
 * {2}{G}, Remove a +1/+1 counter from this creature: Put a +1/+1 counter on target creature.
 *
 * "Enters with" is a replacement effect, never an ETB trigger — the counters are there as it
 * arrives, so nothing can respond in between. The activation is two cost atoms in one line: the
 * mana and a self-scoped counter removal, which is what makes the ability self-limiting.
