/**
 * Disappearing Act
 * {1}{U}{U}
 * Instant
 * As an additional cost to cast this spell, return a permanent you control to its owner's hand.
 * Counter target spell.
 *
 * The Familiar's Ruse shape with the bounce widened from a creature to any permanent. The return is
 * an *additional cost* (CR 601.2f), paid as the spell is cast — so a player with no permanent can't
 * cast it at all, and the bounce still happens if the counter is later fizzled.
 * `CostAtom.ReturnToHand` already scopes its filter to permanents you control, so the filter here
 * is the bare [GameObjectFilter.Permanent].
