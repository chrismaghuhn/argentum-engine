/**
 * Rockcaster Platoon
 * {5}{W}{W}
 * Creature — Rhino Soldier
 * 5 / 7
 * {4}{G}: This creature deals 2 damage to each creature with flying and each player.
 *
 * "Each creature with flying and each player" is two iterations, not one — the Thrashing Wumpus
 * idiom. A group pass over [GroupFilter.AllCreatures]`.withKeyword(FLYING)` deals the damage to
 * [EffectTarget.IterationEntity] (the current iteration entity), and a [Effects.ForEachPlayer] pass over
 * [Player.Each] rebinds the controller each time so [EffectTarget.Controller] is the player being
 * processed. The activation cost is a plain off-colour [Costs.Mana].
