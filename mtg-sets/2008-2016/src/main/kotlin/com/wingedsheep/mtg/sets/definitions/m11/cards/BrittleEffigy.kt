/**
 * Brittle Effigy
 * {1}
 * Artifact
 *
 * {4}, {T}, Exile this artifact: Exile target creature.
 *
 * A three-part activation cost — mana, tap, and [Costs.ExileSelf] — over a plain [Effects.Exile] of
 * the chosen creature. The self-exile is a *cost*, so it happens on activation and can't be
 * responded to; the ability still resolves (and still exiles the creature) if the Effigy is already
 * gone from the battlefield by then. The ability is activated from the battlefield like any other
 * permanent ability, so `activateFromZone` stays at its default.
