/**
 * Scornful Aether-Lich
 * {3}{U}
 * Artifact Creature — Zombie Wizard
 * 2/4
 * {W}{B}: This creature gains fear and vigilance until end of turn. (Attacking doesn't cause it to
 * tap, and it can't be blocked except by artifact creatures and/or black creatures.)
 *
 * One activation granting two keywords: [Effects.Composite] over two [Effects.GrantKeyword] calls
 * onto [EffectTarget.Self], each defaulting to `Duration.EndOfTurn`. Two grants rather than one
 * because a grant carries a single keyword — the same shape Gravelgill Duo uses for its fear.
