 *
 * Darkness Descends' shape (`ForEachInGroup` over `GroupFilter.AllCreatures`, `EffectTarget.IterationEntity`
 * bound to each creature in turn) with the fixed count swapped for the dynamic one. Counters
 * rather than a -X/-X effect is the whole point of the card: they stick past end of turn, and a
 * creature reduced to 0 toughness dies to state-based actions.
