/**
 * Beacon Behemoth
 * {3}{G}{G}
 * Creature — Beast
 * 5 / 3
 * {1}: Target creature with power 5 or greater gains vigilance until end of turn.
 *
 * The power threshold is a restriction on the *target*, not a condition on the effect —
 * `TargetFilter.Creature.powerAtLeast(5)`, so it is checked on announcement and rechecked against
 * projected state on resolution. The Behemoth is itself a 5/3, so it is a legal target for its own
 * ability. The grant is [Effects.GrantKeyword] with its default `Duration.EndOfTurn`, which is
 * exactly the printed "until end of turn". Same shape as Bloodthorn Taunter, with a mana cost in
 * place of the tap.
