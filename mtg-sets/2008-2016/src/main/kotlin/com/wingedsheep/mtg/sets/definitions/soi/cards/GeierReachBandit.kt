/**
 * Geier Reach Bandit // Vildin-Pack Alpha (Shadows over Innistrad — the card's earliest
 * printing; also reprinted in Shadows over Innistrad Remastered and Innistrad Remastered)
 *
 * Front — Geier Reach Bandit ({2}{R}, Creature — Human Rogue Werewolf, 3/2)
 *   Haste
 *   At the beginning of each upkeep, if no spells were cast last turn, transform this creature.
 *
 * Back — Vildin-Pack Alpha (Creature — Werewolf, 4/3)
 *   Whenever a Werewolf you control enters, you may transform it.
 *   At the beginning of each upkeep, if a player cast two or more spells last turn, transform
 *   this creature.
 *
 * Implementation:
 *  - Both upkeep flips are the standard Werewolf pair: `Triggers.anyPlayer.beginningOf(Step.UPKEEP)` with an
 *    intervening-if on [DynamicAmounts.spellsCastLastTurn] (== 0 front, >= 2 back).
 *  - The back's ETB watcher is `Triggers.a(filter).enters()` with [TriggerBinding.ANY] over
 *    "Werewolf you control" — Oracle says *a* Werewolf, not *another*, so Vildin-Pack Alpha
 *    entering (e.g. put onto the battlefield transformed) triggers it on itself too. The
 *    optional flip is [Effects.May] over a [TransformEffect] aimed at
 *    [EffectTarget.TriggeringEntity], so it flips the permanent that entered rather than the
 *    Alpha.
