 * Rise of the Dark Realms

 *
 * Put all creature cards from all graveyards onto the battlefield under your control.
 *
 * `Player.Each` gathers every player's graveyard at once, so this sweeps up your own dead
 * as well as your opponents'. The moved cards enter the battlefield under *your* control:
 * `CardDestination.ToZone` defaults its `player` to [Player.You] (the spell's controller) and
 * `underOwnersControl` stays false, so the caster — not each card's owner — controls them.
