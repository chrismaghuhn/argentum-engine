 * Sangrite Surge
 * {4}{R}{G}
 * Sorcery
 * Target creature gets +3/+3 and gains double strike until end of turn.
 *
 * One target, two riders: [Effects.ModifyStats] and [Effects.GrantKeyword] both point at the same
 * bound target and both take their default `Duration.EndOfTurn`, which is exactly the printed
 * "until end of turn" governing the whole sentence. Composing them keeps the pump and the grant
 * as separate continuous effects, so each lands in its own layer.
