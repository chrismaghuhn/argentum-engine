/**
 * Manic Vandal — Magic 2011 #151
 * {2}{R} · Creature — Human Warrior · 2 / 2
 *
 * When this creature enters, destroy target artifact.
 *
 * The Oxidda Scrapmelter shape: a SELF-bound `Triggers.self.enters()` over [Effects.Destroy],
 * which lowers to a graveyard move flagged `byDestruction` so indestructible and regeneration see
 * it. The trigger is not optional and its target is not "up to", so it must pick an artifact when
 * one is on the battlefield — including one of yours when the opponent has none.
