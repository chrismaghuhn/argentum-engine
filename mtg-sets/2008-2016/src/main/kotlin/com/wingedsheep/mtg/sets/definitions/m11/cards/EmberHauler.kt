/**
 * Ember Hauler
 * {R}{R}
 * Creature — Goblin
 * 2/2
 *
 * {1}, Sacrifice this creature: It deals 2 damage to any target.
 *
 * The sacrifice is part of the activation cost ([Costs.SacrificeSelf]), not an effect, so the
 * Hauler is already in the graveyard when the ability resolves — "it" is the source, which is what
 * [Effects.DealDamage] uses by default, so no explicit `damageSource` is written.
