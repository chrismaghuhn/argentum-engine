 * Enchantment — Aura

 * Enchant creature
 * Enchanted creature has forestwalk. (It can't be blocked as long as defending player controls a Forest.)
 *
 * The green single-keyword member of the landwalk-Aura family — Cave Sense without the pump.
 * `auraTarget = Targets.Creature` is the printed "Enchant creature" restriction; the static
 * [GrantKeyword] has no filter, so the usual Aura auto-targeting points it at the enchanted
 * creature. Granted landwalk is engine-live: `BlockEvasionRules.LandwalkRule` reads the keyword out
 * of projected state and maps `FORESTWALK` to the Forest subtype.
