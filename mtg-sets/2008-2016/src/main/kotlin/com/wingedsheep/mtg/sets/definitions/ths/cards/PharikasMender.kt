/**
 * Pharika's Mender
 * {3}{B}{G}
 * Creature — Gorgon
 * 4 / 3
 *
 * When this creature enters, you may return target creature or enchantment card from your graveyard to your hand.
 *
 * - The graveyard is carried by the *target filter's* `zone`, not by a `fromZone` guard on the move:
 *   a targeted return re-checks its target's legality at resolution (CR 608.2b), so the guard would
 *   be redundant. [Effects.ReturnToHand]'s KDoc spells out the same split.
 * - The printed "you may" is the builder's `optional = true`, which lowers to a `Gate.MayDecide`
 *   around the return.
