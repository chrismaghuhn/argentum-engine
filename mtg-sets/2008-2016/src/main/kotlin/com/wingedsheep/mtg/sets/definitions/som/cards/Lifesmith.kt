/**
 * Lifesmith — Scars of Mirrodin #124
 * {1}{G} · Creature — Human Artificer · 2 / 1
 *
 * Whenever you cast an artifact spell, you may pay {1}. If you do, you gain 3 life.
 *
 * A cast trigger (`Triggers.you.casts(spell, requires)` over [GameObjectFilter.Artifact]), so it goes on the
 * stack above the artifact and resolves first — the payment is offered whether or not the artifact
 * ever resolves, and a countered artifact spell still gained you the life. The optional payment is
 * [Effects.MayPay], the flat mana [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.effects.Gate.MayPay] shape the
 * engine recognizes for manual mana-source selection at resolution.
