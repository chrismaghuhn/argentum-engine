/**
 * Ajani's Mantra
 * {1}{W}
 * Enchantment
 *
 * At the beginning of your upkeep, you may gain 1 life.
 *
 * `Triggers.you.beginningOf(Step.UPKEEP)` is `StepEvent(Step.UPKEEP, Player.You)` with `TriggerBinding.ANY` — the
 * enchantment's own controller's upkeep. The printed "you may" is the builder's `optional = true`,
 * which lowers to a `Gate.MayDecide` around the life gain rather than living beside it as a flag
 * (same shape as Angel's Feather). [Effects.GainLife]'s default recipient is the ability's
 * controller, which is who "you" means here.
