 * 1/1
 * Whenever this creature or another Ally you control enters, you may put a +1/+1 counter on this creature.

 * Rally is an ability word, not a keyword: the trigger is an ANY-bound enters trigger over
 * Allies you control, so this creature's own arrival fires it alongside every later Ally.
 * The printed "you may" is the builder's `optional = true`, which lowers to a `Gate.MayDecide`
 * around the counter.
