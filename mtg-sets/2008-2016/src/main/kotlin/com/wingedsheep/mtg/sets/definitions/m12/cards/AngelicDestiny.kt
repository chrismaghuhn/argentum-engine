 * Enchantment — Aura
 * Enchant creature
 * Enchanted creature gets +4/+4, has flying and first strike, and is an Angel in addition
 * to its other types.
 * When enchanted creature dies, return this card to its owner's hand.
 *
 * The return clause moves *this Aura* (not the dead creature) — by the time the trigger
 * resolves the Aura has already been put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action,
 * so [EffectTarget.Self] picks it up there (same shape as Spine of Ish Sah).
