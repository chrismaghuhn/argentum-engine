/**
 * Deathless Angel
 * {4}{W}{W}
 * Creature — Angel
 * 5 / 7
 *
 * Flying
 * {W}{W}: Target creature gains indestructible until end of turn.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *  - `Effects.GrantKeyword(Keyword.INDESTRUCTIBLE, target)` with the facade's default
 *    `Duration.EndOfTurn`, matching the printed "until end of turn". A keyword grant, not a
 *    damage-prevention shield: the creature shrugs off lethal damage and "destroy" but still dies
 *    to 0 toughness or to sacrifice.
 *  - `Targets.Creature` — the printed line says "target creature", with no "you control"
 *    restriction, so an opponent's creature is a legal target too.
 *  - The ability has no tap symbol and no other cost, so it is `Costs.Mana("{W}{W}")` alone and can
 *    be activated repeatedly, including the turn this enters.
