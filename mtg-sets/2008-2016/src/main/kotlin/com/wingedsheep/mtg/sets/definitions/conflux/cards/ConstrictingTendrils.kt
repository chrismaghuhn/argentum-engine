 * One [Effects.ModifyStats] over a named target; the facade's default duration is already
 * `Duration.EndOfTurn`, so the printed "until end of turn" needs no argument. The -0 toughness
 * half is still written explicitly — it is the printed modifier, not an omission. Cycling is
 * [KeywordAbility.cycling], which carries its own cost and lowers to the discard-and-draw
 * activated ability.
