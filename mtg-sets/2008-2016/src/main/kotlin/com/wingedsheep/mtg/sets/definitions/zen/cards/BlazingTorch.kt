/**
 * Blazing Torch
 * {1}
 * Artifact — Equipment — Uncommon (ZEN #197)
 *
 * "Equipped creature can't be blocked by Vampires or Zombies.
 *  Equipped creature has "{T}, Sacrifice Blazing Torch: Blazing Torch deals 2 damage to any target."
 *  Equip {1}"
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 *  - The evasion clause is [CantBeBlockedBy] over "creature that is a Vampire or a Zombie"
 *    ([GameObjectFilter.withAnySubtype]), scoped to [Filters.EquippedCreature].
 *  - The quoted ability is granted to the bearer via [GrantActivatedAbility] (the Deconstruction
 *    Hammer idiom): the `{T}` taps *that creature* (CR 113.7 — the granted ability's source is the
 *    creature, so it is also subject to summoning sickness), and its controller pays the cost.
 *  - "Sacrifice Blazing Torch" names the specific granting Equipment (CR 201.5a), so the cost is
 *    [Costs.SacrificeGrantingPermanent] — correct even with a second Blazing Torch in play, and it
 *    never offers the creature's own controller a choice of which artifact to sacrifice.
 *  - "**Blazing Torch** deals 2 damage" — the damage source is the Equipment, not the creature, so
 *    `damageSource = EffectTarget.GrantingSource`. This matters: the Torch has been sacrificed by
 *    the time the ability resolves (last-known information), it is a colorless artifact source, and
 *    a lifelinking / deathtouching bearer must not lend those abilities to the damage.
