/**
 * Viashino Skeleton
 * {3}{R}
 * Creature — Lizard Skeleton
 * 2 / 1
 * {1}{B}, Discard a card: Regenerate this creature.
 *
 * A single activated ability. The printed price is two cost atoms joined by [Costs.Composite] —
 * [Costs.Mana] for the `{1}{B}` and the parameterless [Costs.DiscardCard], whose defaults (one
 * card, any card, chosen by the player) are exactly what "Discard a card" means. The effect is
 * [RegenerateEffect] on [EffectTarget.Self]: regeneration is a shield the engine already knows how
 * to hang on the source, so no new vocabulary is involved.
