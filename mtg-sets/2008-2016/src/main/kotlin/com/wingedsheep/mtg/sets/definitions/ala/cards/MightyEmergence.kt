/**
 * Mighty Emergence
 * {2}{G}
 * Enchantment
 * Whenever a creature you control with power 5 or greater enters, you may put two +1/+1 counters on it.
 *
 * The watcher is `Triggers.a(filter).enters()` over `GameObjectFilter.Creature.youControl().powerAtLeast(5)`
 * with [TriggerBinding.ANY] — the enchantment can never be the creature that entered, and the printed
 * line says "a creature", not "another". The counters land on [EffectTarget.TriggeringEntity] (the
 * creature that entered, not a fresh target), and `optional = true` lowers the printed "you may" into
 * the same `Gate.MayDecide` a hand-written `Effects.May` would build.
