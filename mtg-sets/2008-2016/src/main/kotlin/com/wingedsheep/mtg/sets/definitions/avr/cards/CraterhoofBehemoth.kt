/**
 * Craterhoof Behemoth — Avacyn Restored #172 (canonical printing)
 * {5}{G}{G}{G} · Creature — Beast · Mythic
 * 5/5
 *
 * Haste
 * When this creature enters, creatures you control gain trample and get +X/+X until end of
 * turn, where X is the number of creatures you control.
 *
 * X is locked in at resolution as the number of creatures you control (which already
 * includes Craterhoof itself, since it is on the battlefield when the ability resolves).
 * Both the keyword grant and the stat boost apply to every creature you control at that
 * time via [Patterns.Group] group helpers (each iterates the projected battlefield), so a
 * creature that enters after resolution is unaffected.
