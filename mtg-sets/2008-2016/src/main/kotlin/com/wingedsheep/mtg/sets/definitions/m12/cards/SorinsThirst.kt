 * Sorin's Thirst — Magic 2012 #110 (canonical printing; reprinted in WAR and M20)
 * {B}{B}
 * Instant
 * Sorin's Thirst deals 2 damage to target creature and you gain 2 life.
 *
 * Damage and life gain are two effects sharing one sentence, not a drain: the 2 life is gained
 * whether or not the damage kills, and it is gained even if the creature has left the
 * battlefield by resolution — as long as the spell still has a legal target.
