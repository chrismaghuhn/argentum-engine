/**
 * Puncturing Light
 * {1}{W}
 * Instant
 *
 * Destroy target attacking or blocking creature with power 3 or less.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *  - The whole card is its target requirement plus `Effects.Destroy`, which is the
 *    move-to-graveyard-by-destruction effect Assay compiles "destroy" to (so regeneration and
 *    indestructible apply as they should).
 *  - "attacking or blocking" is the single `TargetFilter.AttackingOrBlockingCreature` predicate —
 *    one `StatePredicate.Or`, not two separate clauses — narrowed by `.powerAtMost(3)` for
 *    "with power 3 or less". Power is read from projected state, so a creature pumped above 3 in
 *    response stops being a legal target.
 *  - Both halves live on the target requirement rather than being checked on resolution: the card
 *    says "target … creature with power 3 or less", so the restriction is part of legality.
