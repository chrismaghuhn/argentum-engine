/**
 * Zendikar Incarnate

 * Creature — Elemental

 *
 * Zendikar Incarnate's power is equal to the number of lands you control.
 *
 * Only the *power* is characteristic-defining (CR 604.3), so this uses [dynamicPower] rather than
 * `dynamicStats` — the printed toughness stays the fixed 4. `AggregateBattlefield` is the corpus's
 * one-battlefield tally, and [Filters.Land] is the bare `IsLand` predicate, so every land you
 * control counts regardless of subtype.
