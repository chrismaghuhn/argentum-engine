 * Bloodpyre Elemental
 * {4}{R}
 * Creature — Elemental
 * 4 / 1
 * Sacrifice this creature: It deals 4 damage to target creature. Activate only as a sorcery.
 *
 * [Costs.SacrificeSelf] is the whole cost, so the Elemental is already gone by the time the ability
 * resolves — "it deals 4 damage" is the ability's source dealing it, which is
 * [Effects.DealDamage]'s default source, so no explicit `damageSource` is needed. "Activate only
 * as a sorcery" is the ability's [TimingRule.SorcerySpeed], a timing rule rather than an
 * activation restriction.
