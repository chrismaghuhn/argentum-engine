/**
 * Archdemon of Unx
 * {5}{B}{B}
 * Creature — Demon
 * 6 / 6
 * Flying, trample
 * At the beginning of your upkeep, sacrifice a non-Zombie creature, then create a 2/2 black Zombie creature token.
 *
 * `Triggers.you.beginningOf(Step.UPKEEP)` over a two-step composite. The printed "sacrifice a non-Zombie creature" is
 * the bare imperative — the ability's own controller sacrifices and no player is named — so it is
 * [Effects.SacrificeOwn], not the `Sacrifice` that names a player; the "non-Zombie" half is a
 * predicate on the filter (`Creature.notSubtype(ZOMBIE)`), which keeps the exclusion in the choice
 * the player is offered rather than in the effect. The `then` is plain sequencing, so the token is
 * created after the sacrifice resolves even when there was nothing to sacrifice.
