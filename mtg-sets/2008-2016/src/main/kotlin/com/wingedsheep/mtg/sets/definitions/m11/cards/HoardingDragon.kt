/**
 * Hoarding Dragon (M11 #144)
 * {3}{R}{R}  Creature — Dragon  4/4
 *
 * Flying
 * When this creature enters, you may search your library for an artifact card, exile it,
 * then shuffle.
 * When this creature dies, you may put the exiled card into its owner's hand.
 *
 * Modeling: the exiled artifact is linked to Hoarding Dragon via `linkToSource = true`, so the
 * dies trigger can find it again through [CardSource.FromLinkedExile] even though the Dragon has
 * already left the battlefield. Both triggers are `optional` ("you may"): declining the ETB does
 * not shuffle; declining the dies trigger leaves the card exiled. The ETB search uses
 * `ChooseUpTo(1)` so the controller may search and find nothing (CR 701.23b).
