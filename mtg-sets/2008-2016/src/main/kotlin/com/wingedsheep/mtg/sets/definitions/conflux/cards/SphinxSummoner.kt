/**
 * Sphinx Summoner
 * {3}{U}{B}
 * Artifact Creature — Sphinx
 * 3 / 3
 * Flying
 * When this creature enters, you may search your library for an artifact creature card, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle.
 *
 * The whole printed search is one [Patterns.Library.searchLibrary]: gather the library, choose up
 * to one match, move it to hand revealed, shuffle, then emit the "a player searched their library"
 * event (CR 701.23) that the pattern already appends. The printed "you may" is `optional = true`,
 * which lowers to a `Gate.MayDecide` around the composite — the search itself asks nothing, so
 * there is exactly one prompt. [GameObjectFilter.ArtifactCreature] is the prebuilt
 * artifact-and-creature conjunction.
