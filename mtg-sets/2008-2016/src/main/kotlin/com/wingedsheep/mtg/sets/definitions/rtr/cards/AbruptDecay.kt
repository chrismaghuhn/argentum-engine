 * This spell can't be countered.

 * Canonical printing: Return to Ravnica, the card's earliest real printing.

 * "This spell can't be countered" is the intrinsic [cantBeCountered] flag, not an effect. The
 * mana-value ceiling rides the target filter — [TargetFilter.manaValueAtMost] — so an illegal
 * choice is refused at targeting rather than fizzling on resolution.
