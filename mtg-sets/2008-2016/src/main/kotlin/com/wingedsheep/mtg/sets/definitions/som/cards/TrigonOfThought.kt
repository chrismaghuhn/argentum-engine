/**
 * Trigon of Thought — Scars of Mirrodin #217
 * {5} · Artifact
 *
 * This artifact enters with three charge counters on it.
 * {U}{U}, {T}: Put a charge counter on this artifact.
 * {2}, {T}, Remove a charge counter from this artifact: Draw a card.
 *
 * The counters it enters with are a replacement effect (CR 614.1c), not a trigger — nothing ever
 * sees the Trigon on the battlefield without them. Recharging and spending are two activated
 * abilities that each tap, so a single turn does one or the other.
