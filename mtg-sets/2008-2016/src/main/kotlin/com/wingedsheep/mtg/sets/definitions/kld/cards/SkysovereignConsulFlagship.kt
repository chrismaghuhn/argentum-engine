/**
 * Skysovereign, Consul Flagship
 * {5}
 * Legendary Artifact — Vehicle
 * 6/5
 *
 * Flying
 * Whenever Skysovereign enters or attacks, it deals 3 damage to target creature or planeswalker an opponent controls.
 * Crew 3 (Tap any number of creatures you control with total power 3 or more: This Vehicle becomes an artifact creature until end of turn.)
 *
 * "Enters **or** attacks" is two trigger conditions on one printed line, and the SDK models a
 * trigger as a single event pattern, so it is authored as two triggered abilities with the same
 * effect and the same target requirement. Each fires independently — a Vehicle that enters and
 * later attacks shoots twice.
 *
 * Crew is the engine's own keyword ability; the Vehicle type on the type line plus
 * [KeywordAbility.crew] is the whole implementation.
