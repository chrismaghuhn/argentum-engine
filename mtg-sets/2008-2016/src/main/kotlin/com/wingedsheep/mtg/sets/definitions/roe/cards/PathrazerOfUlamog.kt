/**
 * Pathrazer of Ulamog
 * {11}
 * Creature — Eldrazi
 * 9 / 9
 *
 * Annihilator 3 (Whenever this creature attacks, defending player sacrifices three permanents of
 * their choice.)
 * This creature can't be blocked except by three or more creatures.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *  - Annihilator is a **display-only** [KeywordAbility.Numeric] in this SDK — nothing in
 *    `rules-engine` reads it — so the card declares it for the printed line *and* lowers the
 *    behaviour by hand, exactly as Artisan of Kozilek does for annihilator 2: a `Triggers.self.attacks()`
 *    triggered ability whose effect is the edict form of [Effects.Sacrifice], where the *defending
 *    player* chooses. Declaring the keyword ability alone would render the reminder text and do
 *    nothing.
 *  - The filter is [GameObjectFilter.Permanent], not `Creature`: annihilator eats any permanent of
 *    the defending player's choice, lands and enchantments included.
 *  - The blocking clause is the generalized-menace static [CantBeBlockedByFewerThan] with
 *    `minBlockers = 3` (menace is the N = 2 case). It may still be left unblocked entirely — the
 *    restriction only bites once at least one creature blocks — which is what "can't be blocked
 *    except by three or more creatures" means.
