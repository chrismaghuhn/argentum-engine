/**
 * Scattershot Archer — Conflux #90
 * {G} · Creature — Elf Archer · 1/2
 *
 * {T}: This creature deals 1 damage to each creature with flying.
 *
 * "Each creature with flying" is untargeted, so it is [Effects.ForEachInGroup] over
 * `Filters.Group.allCreatures.withKeyword(Keyword.FLYING)` rather than a target requirement —
 * `IterationSpace.Group` binds each flier in turn as the body's [EffectTarget.IterationEntity], so a single
 * one-damage facade applies once per flier. The group is snapshotted before the first iteration,
 * and each flier takes damage from this creature independently (so lifelink, deathtouch, and
 * protection from green all read the archer as the source).
