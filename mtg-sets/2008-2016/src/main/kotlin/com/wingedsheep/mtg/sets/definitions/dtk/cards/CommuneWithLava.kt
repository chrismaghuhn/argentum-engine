/**

 *
 * Exile the top X cards of your library. Until the end of your next turn, you may play those cards.
 *
 * The impulse-draw recipe with a dynamic count: [Patterns.Exile.impulse] gathers the top X, moves
 * that same stored collection to exile, and grants play permission over it — one variable name
 * threaded through all three steps, which is what makes "those cards" refer to the exact cards
 * exiled. "Until the end of your next turn" is
 * [MayPlayExpiry.UntilControllerStep] at the cleanup step with `includeCurrentTurn = false`, so the
 * permission survives this turn even when the spell is cast on your own turn.
