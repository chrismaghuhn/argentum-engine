/**
 * Parasitic Strix
 * {2}{U}
 * Artifact Creature — Bird
 * 2 / 2
 * Flying
 * When this creature enters, if you control a black permanent, target player loses 2 life and you gain 2 life.
 *
 * Conflux's "domain of a colour" clause is an ordinary intervening-"if" (CR 603.4), so it is
 * checked both when the Strix enters and again on resolution — losing the last black permanent in
 * response fizzles the drain. [Conditions.YouControl] over `Permanent.withColor(BLACK)` is the
 * existential the JSON names `Exists(You, Battlefield, …)`; the bare noun "permanent" is
 * deliberately not narrowed to creatures. The drain is one [Effects.Composite] of a targeted
 * [Effects.LoseLife] and an untargeted [Effects.GainLife], whose controller default is already you.
