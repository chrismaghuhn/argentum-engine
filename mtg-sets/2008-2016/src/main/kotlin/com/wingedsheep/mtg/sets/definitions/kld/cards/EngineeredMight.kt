/**
 * Engineered Might
 * {3}{G}{W}
 * Sorcery
 *
 * Choose one —
 * • Target creature gets +5/+5 and gains trample until end of turn.
 * • Creatures you control get +2/+2 and gain vigilance until end of turn.
 *
 * Two shapes of the same sentence, so they are written two different ways. The first mode names a
 * single target once and says two things about it, which is a plain composite of
 * [Effects.ModifyStats] and [Effects.GrantKeyword] over that one bound target. The second names a
 * *group* once and says two things about it, which is [Patterns.Group.pumpAndGrantToAll] — the
 * group is gathered a single time on resolution, so creatures that arrive later in the turn get
 * neither half.
