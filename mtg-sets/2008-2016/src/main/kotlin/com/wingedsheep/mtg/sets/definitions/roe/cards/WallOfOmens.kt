/**
 * Wall of Omens
 * {1}{W}
 * Creature — Wall
 * 0 / 4
 *
 * Defender
 * When this creature enters, draw a card.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *  - Defender is the bare keyword — the engine's combat code reads `Keyword.DEFENDER` off the card,
 *    so `keywords(...)` alone is the whole ability (the corpus convention; a separate
 *    `keywordAbility` row would only duplicate it).
 *  - "**When** this creature enters" is the one-shot `Triggers.self.enters()`.
 *  - "Draw a card" is untargeted and drawn by the controller, which is [Effects.DrawCards]'s
 *    default recipient, so no target argument is written.
