/**
 * Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger — Battle for Zendikar #15
 * {10} · Legendary Creature — Eldrazi · 10/10 · Mythic
 *
 * When you cast this spell, exile two target permanents.
 * Indestructible
 * Whenever Ulamog attacks, defending player exiles the top twenty cards of their library.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *  - The exile is a **cast trigger** (`Triggers.self.isCast()`), not an ETB — per the
 *    2015-08-25 ruling it resolves independently of Ulamog and before Ulamog itself, and it
 *    still resolves even if Ulamog is countered (see [com.wingedsheep.mtg.sets.definitions.roe.cards.ArtisanOfKozilek]
 *    for the same pattern on a smaller Eldrazi titan). Two simultaneous targets use
 *    [TargetPermanent] with `count = 2` plus [ForEachTargetEffect] so each is exiled
 *    independently even if one becomes illegal.
 *  - The attack trigger is the lowering of the (unprinted, purely descriptive here) "mill 20"
 *    effect via [Patterns.Library.exileTop], targeting [Player.DefendingPlayer] — same shape as
 *    Malboro's "exile the top N cards of a player's library." Per the 2015-08-25 ruling, if the
 *    defending player has fewer than twenty cards left, all of them are exiled and the empty
 *    library alone doesn't cause a loss (only a forced draw from it would).
