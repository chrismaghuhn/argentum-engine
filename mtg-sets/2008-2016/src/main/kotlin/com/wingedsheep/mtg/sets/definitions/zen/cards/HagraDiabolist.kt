/**
 * Hagra Diabolist
 * {4}{B}
 * Creature — Ogre Shaman Ally
 * 3/2
 * Whenever this creature or another Ally you control enters, you may have target player lose life equal to the number of Allies you control.
 *
 * Rally is an ability word, not a keyword: the trigger is an ANY-bound enters trigger over
 * Allies you control, so this creature's own arrival fires it alongside every later Ally.
 * The printed "you may" is the builder's `optional = true`, which lowers to a `Gate.MayDecide`
 * around the counter.
 *
 * "The number of Allies you control" is counted on resolution, and counts permanents — an
 * Ally land or artifact counts as readily as an Ally creature.
