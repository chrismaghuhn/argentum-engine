 * Lumengrid Drake

 * Creature — Drake
 * 2/2
 *
 * Flying
 * Metalcraft — When this creature enters, if you control three or more artifacts, return target creature to its owner's hand.
 *
 * Metalcraft is an ability word, not a keyword: it survives only in the printed text, and the rules
 * text is an ordinary intervening-if clause on the enters trigger. As an intervening if it is
 * checked twice (CR 603.4) — once when the Drake enters, and again as the ability resolves — so
 * losing the third artifact in response fizzles the bounce.
