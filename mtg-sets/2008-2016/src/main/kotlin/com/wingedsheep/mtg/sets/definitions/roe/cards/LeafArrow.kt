/**
 * Leaf Arrow
 * {G}
 * Instant
 *
 * Leaf Arrow deals 3 damage to target creature with flying.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *  - "with flying" is a restriction on *which creature can be chosen*, not a condition checked on
 *    resolution, so it lives on the target requirement: Assay compiles one `TargetObject` carrying
 *    both `IsCreature` and `HasKeyword FLYING`, which is exactly
 *    [Targets.CreatureWithKeyword]`(Keyword.FLYING)`. Written as a condition instead, the spell
 *    could be aimed at a ground creature and simply do nothing — the wrong behaviour.
 *  - Target legality is re-checked on resolution (CR 608.2b) off projected state, so a creature
 *    that loses flying in response makes the spell fizzle. That falls out of putting the keyword
 *    in the filter.
