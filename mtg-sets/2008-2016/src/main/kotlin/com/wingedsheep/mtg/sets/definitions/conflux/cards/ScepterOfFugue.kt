 * The discard is the shared [Patterns.Hand.discardCards] recipe (gather the target's hand →
 * they choose one → move it to their graveyard as a discard). Pointing it at the bound target
 * is the whole of "target player discards": the pattern derives both the hand it gathers and
 * the player who chooses from that one argument.
