/**
 * Ruthless Deathfang
 * {4}{U}{B}
 * Creature — Dragon
 * 4 / 4
 *
 * Flying
 * Whenever you sacrifice a creature, target opponent sacrifices a creature of their choice.
 *
 * The printed article is bare — "a creature", not "another creature" — so this is
 * `Triggers.you.sacrifices(filter)`, the per-permanent template that *counts the Dragon sacrificing itself*
 * ([com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.TriggerBinding.ANY]), and not `Triggers.you.sacrificesAnother(filter)`.
 * Per-permanent also means CR 603.2c multiplicity: sacrificing two creatures to one cost fires it
 * twice, which is the whole point of the singular wording.
 *
 * "Sacrifices a creature of their choice" names the player who must sacrifice, so the effect is
 * [Effects.Sacrifice] pointed at the target opponent — the chooser is the sacrificing player, which
 * is what that facade already models. (The bare-imperative sibling `SacrificeOwn` would make *you*
 * sacrifice instead.)
