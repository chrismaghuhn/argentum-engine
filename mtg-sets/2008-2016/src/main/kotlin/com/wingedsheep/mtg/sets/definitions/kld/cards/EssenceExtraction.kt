/**
 * Essence Extraction
 * {1}{B}{B}
 * Instant
 *
 * Essence Extraction deals 3 damage to target creature and you gain 3 life.
 *
 * A plain composite: the damage is attributed to the spell itself, so no explicit damage source is
 * written, and the life gain names no player, which is the SDK's default of the effect's
 * controller. The two halves are independent — the life is gained even if the creature has already
 * left the battlefield.
