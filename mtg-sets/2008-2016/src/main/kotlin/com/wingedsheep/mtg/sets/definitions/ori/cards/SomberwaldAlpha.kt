/**
 * Somberwald Alpha
 * {3}{G}
 * Creature — Wolf
 * 3/2
 *
 * Whenever a creature you control becomes blocked, it gets +1/+1 until end of turn.
 * {1}{G}: Target creature you control gains trample until end of turn. (It can deal excess combat damage to the player or planeswalker it's attacking.)
 *
 * "it" in the trigger is the blocked creature, not the Alpha, so the pump targets
 * [EffectTarget.TriggeringEntity] — the ANY-bound `becomesBlocked` binds the creature that became
 * blocked, which is exactly what the pronoun refers to.
