/**
 * Lightning Talons
 * {2}{R}
 * Enchantment — Aura
 * Enchant creature
 * Enchanted creature gets +3/+0 and has first strike. (It deals combat damage before creatures without first strike.)
 *
 * "Enchant creature" is the aura's attachment restriction *and* its cast-time target, so it is
 * `auraTarget = `[Targets.Creature] rather than a `target()` handle. The printed "and" joins two
 * independent grants in different layers — a P/T modification (layer 7c) and an ability grant
 * (layer 6) — so it is two [ModifyStats] / [GrantKeyword] static abilities over the implicit
 * enchanted permanent, not one fused effect.
