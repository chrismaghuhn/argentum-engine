 * "Can't be blocked" is an evasion [AbilityFlag] rather than a [com.wingedsheep.sdk.core.Keyword] —
 * there is no keyword for it to abbreviate — and the blocking rules read the flag directly when
 * legal blocks are enumerated. "Up to two" is one target requirement with `count = 2, optional = true`,
 * and [ForEachTargetEffect] runs the grant once per target that was actually chosen.
