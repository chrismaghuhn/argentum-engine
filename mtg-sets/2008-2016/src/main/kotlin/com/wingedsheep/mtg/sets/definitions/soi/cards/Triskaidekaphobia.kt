/**
 * Triskaidekaphobia
 * {3}{B}
 * Enchantment
 * At the beginning of your upkeep, choose one —
 * • Each player with exactly 13 life loses the game, then each player gains 1 life.
 * • Each player with exactly 13 life loses the game, then each player loses 1 life.
 *
 * "Each player with exactly 13 life loses the game" is a [ForEachPlayerEffect] (APNAP order) whose
 * body rebinds the controller context to the iterated player, so [DynamicAmount.LifeTotal] of
 * [Player.You] reads *that* player's life (see Pox Plague) — a per-player [Effects.If]
 * makes them lose the game when it equals 13. Both modes share that clause; only the trailing
 * "each player gains / loses 1 life" differs.
