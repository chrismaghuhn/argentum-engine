/**
 * Butcher's Glee
 * {2}{B}
 * Instant
 *
 * Target creature gets +3/+0 and gains lifelink until end of turn. Regenerate it. (Damage dealt by a creature with lifelink also causes its controller to gain that much life.)
 *
 * Two printed sentences, so two elements at the top level: the pump-and-lifelink sentence is one
 * nested [Effects.Composite] and "Regenerate it" is its sibling. Chaining with `then` would splice
 * the inner composite's members into a flat three-element list and lose that arity. There is no
 * `Effects.Regenerate` facade — [RegenerateEffect] is the shipped spelling (Death Ward, Reknit) —
 * and "it" is the creature just pumped, so every effect points at the same bound handle.
