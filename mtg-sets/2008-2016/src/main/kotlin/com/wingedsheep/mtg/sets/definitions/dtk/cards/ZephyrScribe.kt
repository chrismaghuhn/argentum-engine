 * Zephyr Scribe
 * {2}{U}
 * Creature — Human Monk
 * 2 / 1
 *
 * {U}, {T}: Draw a card, then discard a card.
 * Whenever you cast a noncreature spell, untap this creature.
 *
 * "Draw a card, then discard a card" is the loot recipe ([Patterns.Hand.loot], draw 1 then the
 * gather/select/discard pipeline), and the untap trigger is a plain `Triggers.you.casts(GameObjectFilter.Noncreature)` —
 * not prowess, which would add a +1/+1 the card doesn't print. Together they let each noncreature
 * spell refund the tap cost, so the ability can be activated once per spell.
