/**
 * Goblin Tunneler — Rise of the Eldrazi #148
 * {1}{R} · Creature — Goblin Rogue · 1 / 1
 *
 * {T}: Target creature with power 2 or less can't be blocked this turn.
 *
 * The Crafty Pathmage shape: the power restriction lives on the target requirement
 * ([Targets.CreatureWithPowerAtMost]), so it is checked on activation and again on resolution
 * (CR 608.2b), while the effect itself is a flat [AbilityFlag.CANT_BE_BLOCKED] grant for the turn.
 * Growing the creature's power after the grant does not strip it — that falls out of granting the
 * flag rather than re-checking power during combat.
