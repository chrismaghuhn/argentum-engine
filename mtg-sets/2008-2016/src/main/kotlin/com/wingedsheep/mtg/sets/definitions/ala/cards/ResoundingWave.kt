/**
 * Resounding Wave
 * {2}{U}
 * Instant
 * Return target permanent to its owner's hand.
 * Cycling {5}{W}{U}{B} ({5}{W}{U}{B}, Discard this card: Draw a card.)
 * When you cycle this card, return two target permanents to their owners' hands.
 *
 * The blue member of the Alara "Resounding" cycle, composed like the Onslaught cycling cycle: a
 * `spell { }` body, [KeywordAbility.cycling] for the wedge-coloured cycling cost, and a
 * `Triggers.self.isCycled()` triggered ability carrying the larger effect. The spell half is a single
 * [Effects.ReturnToHand]; the trigger declares a `count = 2` [TargetPermanent] requirement and fans
 * the bounce out with [ForEachTargetEffect] so each chosen permanent is moved independently — one
 * illegal target on resolution no longer costs the other its bounce. Unlike the Onslaught cycle
 * there is no printed "you may", so the trigger is not optional, and "two target permanents" is a
 * hard count rather than "up to two".
