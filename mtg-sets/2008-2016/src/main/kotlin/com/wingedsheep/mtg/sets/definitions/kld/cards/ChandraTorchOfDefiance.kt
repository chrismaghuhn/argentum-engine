/**
 * Chandra, Torch of Defiance — Kaladesh #110
 * {2}{R}{R} · Legendary Planeswalker — Chandra · Starting loyalty 4
 *
 * +1: Exile the top card of your library. You may cast that card. If you don't, Chandra deals 2
 *     damage to each opponent.
 * +1: Add {R}{R}.
 * −3: Chandra deals 4 damage to target creature.
 * −7: You get an emblem with "Whenever you cast a spell, this emblem deals 5 damage to any target."
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *
 *  - **The first +1** casts *during resolution* (ruling: "You can't wait to cast it later in the
 *    turn"), paying its costs — [Effects.CastFromCollection], not a may-play grant. Only a nonland
 *    card is offered (a land can't be *cast*, so a land flip always deals the 2 damage). The "If
 *    you don't" branch is an [Effects.IfYouDo] keyed on the collection the cast publishes to, so
 *    declining the "may", flipping a land, being unable to pay, or having no legal targets for
 *    the spell all fall through to the damage.
 *  - **The second +1** is a loyalty ability, not a mana ability (ruling) — it uses the stack.
 *  - **The emblem** is a global triggered ability ([Effects.CreateGlobalTriggeredAbility]), so it
 *    outlives Chandra, and it triggers (and resolves) above the spell that caused it.
