/**
 * Captain of the Mists
 * {2}{U}
 * Creature — Human Wizard
 * 2/3
 * Whenever another Human you control enters, untap this creature.
 * {1}{U}, {T}: You may tap or untap target permanent.
 *
 * "You may tap or untap target permanent" is the corpus idiom for the clause — a [Effects.May] over a
 * two-[Mode] [ModalEffect] with `countsAsModalSpell = false`, shared with Pestermite, Stonybrook
 * Angler, Merrow Reejerey, Granite Witness, Sewer-veillance Cam, Elite Interceptor and Inverted
 * Iceberg. The target is locked in when the ability goes on the stack; the tap-or-untap choice is
 * made on resolution, so a responding tap does not strand the controller on the useless half.
 *
 * It was written as an `Effects.ChooseAction` over two `EffectChoice`s until Argentum Assay learned
 * to read the clause and the differential put the two spellings side by side. `ChooseActionEffect`
 * filters infeasible options and auto-selects when one remains, which quietly takes away a choice
 * the rules leave open — tapping an already-tapped permanent is legal and simply does nothing.
