/**
 * Jund Battlemage
 * {2}{R}
 * Creature — Human Shaman
 * 2 / 2
 * {B}, {T}: Target player loses 1 life.
 * {G}, {T}: Create a 1/1 green Saproling creature token.
 *
 * One of the Alara shard battlemages: a mono-coloured body with two off-colour activated abilities,
 * so each is a [Costs.Composite] of a single [Costs.Mana] pip plus [Costs.Tap]. The tap is shared,
 * which is what makes the two modes exclusive on any given turn. "Target player" is unrestricted
 * ([Targets.Player]) — it may be pointed at yourself — and the Saproling is spelled entirely by its
 * printed characteristics through the shared [Effects.CreateToken] facade, so no bespoke token
 * definition is needed.
