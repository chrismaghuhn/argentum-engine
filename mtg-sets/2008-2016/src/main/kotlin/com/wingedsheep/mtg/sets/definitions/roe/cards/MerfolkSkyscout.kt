/**
 * Merfolk Skyscout
 * {2}{U}{U}
 * Creature — Merfolk Scout
 * 2 / 3
 *
 * Flying
 * Whenever this creature attacks or blocks, untap target permanent.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *  - "Attacks or blocks" is **two** triggered abilities sharing one effect. Attacking and blocking
 *    are separate events, and the SDK has no combined `AttacksOrBlocks` trigger — `Triggers.self.attacks()`
 *    and `Triggers.self.blocks()` are the two spellings, the Daemogoth Titan / Hamlet Captain / Elder
 *    Gargaroth shape. Assay's own JSON compiles this sentence into exactly two `triggeredAbilities`
 *    (`AttackEvent` and `BlockEvent`), so the pair is authoring to the model, not a workaround.
 *    Two abilities is also rules-correct: a creature that attacks and is later blocked triggers
 *    only the attack half, and each trigger picks its own target.
 *  - Each half declares its own [Targets.Permanent] requirement — the target is chosen as the
 *    ability goes on the stack (CR 603.3d), which is why it cannot be shared between the two.
 *  - "Untap target permanent" is mandatory and unconditional: no `optional`, and the target is any
 *    permanent (either controller's), matching Assay's bare `IsPermanent` predicate.
 *  - Neither half sets a `description`: the corpus leaves the paired triggers to auto-render, so
 *    the client shows one line per event rather than printing the joined sentence twice.
