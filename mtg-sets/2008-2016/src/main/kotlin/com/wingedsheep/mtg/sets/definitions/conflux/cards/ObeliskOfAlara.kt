/**
 * Obelisk of Alara
 * {6}
 * Artifact
 * {1}{W}, {T}: You gain 5 life.
 * {1}{U}, {T}: Draw a card, then discard a card.
 * {1}{B}, {T}: Target creature gets -2/-2 until end of turn.
 * {1}{R}, {T}: This artifact deals 3 damage to target player or planeswalker.
 * {1}{G}, {T}: Target creature gets +4/+4 until end of turn.
 *
 * Five independent activated abilities, one per colour, each a mana-plus-tap [Costs.Composite].
 * They are five abilities rather than one modal effect because each has its own cost — a mode is
 * chosen after a single cost is paid, and nothing here shares one; the tap is separately paid and
 * so only one can be activated per untap step anyway.
 *
 * "Draw a card, then discard a card" is the corpus's standing composition: [Effects.DrawCards]
 * followed by the [Patterns.Hand.discardCards] pipeline (gather hand → choose one → move to
 * graveyard as a discard), both defaulting to the ability's controller.
 *
 * The pump and the shrink are the same [Effects.ModifyStats] with opposite signs; its default
 * duration is already `Duration.EndOfTurn`, so the printed "until end of turn" needs no argument.
