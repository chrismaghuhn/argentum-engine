/**
 * Azorius Charm
 * {W}{U}
 * Instant
 *
 * Choose one —
 * • Creatures you control gain lifelink until end of turn.
 * • Draw a card.
 * • Put target attacking or blocking creature on top of its owner's library.
 *
 * Canonical printing: Return to Ravnica, the card's earliest real printing.
 *
 * A plain choose-one `modal(chooseCount = 1)`. The mass grant is [Effects.ForEachInGroup] over
 * [GroupFilter.AllCreaturesYouControl] with [EffectTarget.IterationEntity] as the per-iteration subject —
 * the creature being visited, not the spell. Only the third mode targets, so only it
 * declares one; a mode's targets are chosen when the mode is (CR 601.2c).
