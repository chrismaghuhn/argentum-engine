/**
 * Blue Sun's Zenith — Mirrodin Besieged #20 (canonical / earliest real printing, 2011)
 * {X}{U}{U}{U} · Instant
 *
 * Target player draws X cards. Shuffle Blue Sun's Zenith into its owner's library.
 *
 * Note the target is a *player*, not "you" — the card is as happy decking an opponent as refilling
 * your own hand. `selfShuffleIntoLibrary()` replaces the CR 608.2n destination; if the spell is
 * countered or its target becomes illegal it goes to the graveyard as usual.
