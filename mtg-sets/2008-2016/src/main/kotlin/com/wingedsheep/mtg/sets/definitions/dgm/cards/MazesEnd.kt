/**
 * Maze's End
 * Land
 * This land enters tapped.
 * {T}: Add {C}.
 * {3}, {T}, Return this land to its owner's hand: Search your library for a Gate card, put it
 * onto the battlefield, then shuffle. If you control ten or more Gates with different names,
 * you win the game.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *  - Returning Maze's End to hand is part of the **cost** (`Costs.ReturnSelfToHand`), not the
 *    effect — per the 2013-04-15 ruling players can't respond between announcement and payment,
 *    and the ability resolves even though its source has left the battlefield.
 *  - The win check happens *as the ability resolves*, after the search, and happens even if no
 *    Gate was found (the search is "search for a Gate card", which may fail or be declined). It's
 *    modeled as a `Effects.If` sequenced after the search rather than a separate trigger,
 *    so it is checked once, at resolution, and never at other times.
 *  - "ten or more Gates with different names" counts each name once, hence
 *    `distinctNames()` — controlling several Guildgates of the same name adds nothing.
 *  - Maze's End itself is a plain Land, not a Gate, so it never counts toward its own total.
