/**
 * Volcanic Strength
 * {1}{R}
 * Enchantment — Aura
 *
 * Enchant creature
 * Enchanted creature gets +2/+2 and has mountainwalk. (It can't be blocked as long as defending player controls a Mountain.)
 *
 * Cave Sense's bigger sibling — the same two-static Aura shape ([ModifyStats] plus a
 * [GrantKeyword]), one size up. The printed "and" joins two separate static abilities rather than
 * one combined type; neither carries a filter, so the Aura's auto-targeting applies both to the
 * enchanted creature. `auraTarget = Targets.Creature` is the "Enchant creature" restriction.
 * Granted landwalk is engine-live: `BlockEvasionRules.LandwalkRule` maps `MOUNTAINWALK` to the
 * Mountain subtype off projected state.
