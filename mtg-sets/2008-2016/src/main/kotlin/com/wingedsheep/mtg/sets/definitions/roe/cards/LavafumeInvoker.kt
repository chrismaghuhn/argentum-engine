/**
 * Lavafume Invoker
 * {2}{R}
 * Creature — Goblin Shaman
 * 2 / 2
 *
 * {8}: Creatures you control get +3/+0 until end of turn.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *  - The invoker ability is a plain [activatedAbility] with a `{8}` mana cost — no tap symbol, no
 *    timing restriction — so it is repeatable and usable at instant speed.
 *  - "Creatures you control" is a **group**, not a target: [Effects.ForEachInGroup] over
 *    [GroupFilter.AllCreaturesYouControl] applies the pump once per member, with
 *    [EffectTarget.IterationEntity] naming the current iteration entity. That is Assay's `ForEach` over an
 *    `IterationSpace.Group` filtered on `IsCreature` + `ControlledByYou`.
 *  - The toughness modifier is written as an explicit `0` because the printed line is `+3/+0`, and
 *    the group is snapshotted on resolution — creatures that arrive later this turn are not pumped.
 *  - [Effects.ModifyStats] already defaults to an end-of-turn duration, so no `duration` is written.
