/**
 * Gustrider Exuberant
 * {2}{W}
 * Creature — Human Wizard
 * 1 / 2
 * Flying
 * Sacrifice this creature: Creatures you control with power 5 or greater gain flying until end of turn.
 *
 * The cost is the bare [Costs.SacrificeSelf] atom — no mana, no tap — so the ability is usable at
 * instant speed even the turn it lands. The grant is [Effects.ForEachInGroup] over a snapshot of
 * `GameObjectFilter.Creature.youControl().powerAtLeast(5)`, with [EffectTarget.IterationEntity] inside the body
 * bound to the current iteration entity; each iteration is a separate
 * [Effects.GrantKeyword] whose default `Duration.EndOfTurn` is the printed duration. Snapshotting
 * before iteration is what makes the grant a one-shot on the creatures present at resolution rather
 * than a continuous "creatures with power 5 or greater have flying".
