/**
 * Desecration Demon
 * {2}{B}{B}
 * Creature — Demon
 * 6/6
 *
 * Flying
 * At the beginning of each combat, any opponent may sacrifice a creature of their choice.
 * If a player does, tap this creature and put a +1/+1 counter on it.
 *
 * Modeled with `Triggers.anyPlayer.beginningOf(Step.BEGIN_COMBAT)` (beginning of combat on every player's turn) and an
 * [AnyPlayerMayPayEffect] scoped to [Player.EachOpponent] — only the controller's opponents are
 * offered the sacrifice. The reflexive consequence (tap self, add one +1/+1 counter) fires once
 * if any opponent sacrifices, matching the ruling that Desecration Demon gets at most one counter
 * per combat regardless of how many creatures were sacrificed.
