/**
 * Stabbing Pain

 * Instant
 *
 * Target creature gets -1/-1 until end of turn. Tap that creature.
 *
 * "That creature" is the same target, not a second one, so both halves take the one `target()`
 * handle — the Magic Damper shape ("… gets +1/+1 … Untap it."). [Effects.ModifyStats]'s duration
 * already defaults to `Duration.EndOfTurn`, which is what the printed "until end of turn" says, and
 * the tap is a plain one-shot with no duration of its own.
