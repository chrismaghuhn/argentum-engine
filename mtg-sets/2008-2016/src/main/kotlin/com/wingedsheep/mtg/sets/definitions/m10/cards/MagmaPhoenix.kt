/**
 * Magma Phoenix
 * {3}{R}{R}
 * Creature — Phoenix
 * 3/3
 *
 * Flying
 * When this creature dies, it deals 3 damage to each creature and each player.
 * {3}{R}{R}: Return this card from your graveyard to your hand.
 *
 * - "each creature and each player" is two iterations, not one: a group iteration over every
 *   creature on the battlefield, then a player iteration over every player (Volcanic Fallout's
 *   shape). Inside a group iteration `EffectTarget.IterationEntity` is the iterated permanent; inside a
 *   player iteration `EffectTarget.Controller` is the iterated player.
 * - The recursion ability is activated from the *graveyard* — `activateFromZone` is what makes it
 *   legal there, and [Effects.ReturnToHandFromGraveyard] carries the `fromZone` guard that stops
 *   a card exiled in response from returning anyway.
