/**
 * Vandalize
 * {4}{R}
 * Sorcery
 *
 * Choose one or both —
 * • Destroy target artifact.
 * • Destroy target land.
 *
 * "Choose one or both" is a *count* over the two printed modes, not a third "do both" mode:
 * `chooseCount = 2` with `minChooseCount = 1` (CR 700.2d), which the SDK renders back as
 * "one or both". See Scour for Scrap for the same correction — an authored "do both" mode reports
 * one chosen mode where the spell actually chose two, which is the Winterflame regression. Each
 * mode declares its own target, so only the chosen modes' targets are chosen on announcement.
