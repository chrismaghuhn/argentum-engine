/**
 * Consuming Aberration
 * {3}{U}{B}
 * Creature — Horror
 * ✶/✶
 *
 * Consuming Aberration's power and toughness are each equal to the number of cards in your
 * opponents' graveyards.
 * Whenever you cast a spell, each opponent reveals cards from the top of their library until
 * they reveal a land card, then puts those cards into their graveyard.
 *
 * The characteristic-defining P/T is [dynamicStats] with a [DynamicAmount.Count] over all
 * opponents' graveyards (Soulless One pattern). The spell-cast trigger wraps the
 * GatherUntilMatch + RevealCollection + MoveCollection pipeline (Sméagol, Helpful Guide
 * pattern) in [Effects.ForEachPlayer] so each opponent walks and bins their own library —
 * the revealed cards, land included, go to that opponent's graveyard.
