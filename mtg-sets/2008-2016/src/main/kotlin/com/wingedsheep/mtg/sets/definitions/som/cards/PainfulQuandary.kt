/**
 * Painful Quandary
 * {3}{B}{B}
 * Enchantment
 *
 * Whenever an opponent casts a spell, that player loses 5 life unless they discard a card.
 *
 * Modeled as an `Triggers.anOpponent.casts()` triggered ability whose payoff is a
 * [PayOrSufferEffect]: the affected player is the caster ([Player.TriggeringPlayer]), who may
 * pay the "cost" of discarding a card ([Costs.pay.Discard]) to avoid the suffer — losing 5 life.
 * Both the paying player and the life-loss target are the triggering player, so the punisher
 * always lands on the caster and never on Painful Quandary's controller.
