/**
 * Naya Battlemage
 * {2}{G}
 * Creature — Human Shaman
 * 2 / 2
 * {R}, {T}: Target creature gets +2/+0 until end of turn.
 * {W}, {T}: Tap target creature.
 *
 * The Invasion "apprentice" shape: two independent activated abilities that share the tap symbol,
 * each gated behind an off-colour mana atom (the shard's other two colours, which is why the
 * colour identity is GRW on a mono-green cost). The first is [Effects.ModifyStats] with the default
 * end-of-turn duration; the second is [TapUntapEffect] with `tap = true`. Each names its own
 * [Targets.Creature] target.
