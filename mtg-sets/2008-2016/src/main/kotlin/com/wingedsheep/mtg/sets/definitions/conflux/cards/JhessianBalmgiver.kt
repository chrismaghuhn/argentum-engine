/**
 * Jhessian Balmgiver
 * {1}{W}{U}
 * Creature — Human Cleric
 * 1 / 1
 * {T}: Prevent the next 1 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn.
 * {T}: Target creature can't be blocked this turn.
 *
 * Two separate {T} abilities, so only one can be used per untap. The first is
 * [Effects.PreventNextDamage] with a fixed amount over an [AnyTarget] — the shield's other
 * knobs (scope, direction, source filter, "this turn" duration) all stay on their defaults.
 * "Can't be blocked" is an [AbilityFlag], not a [com.wingedsheep.sdk.core.Keyword]: the blocking
 * rules read the flag, so granting it through [Effects.GrantKeyword]'s flag overload is what
 * actually makes the creature unblockable rather than merely printing a word on it.
