/**
 * Magmaw
 * {3}{R}{R}
 * Creature — Elemental
 * 4 / 4
 *
 * {1}, Sacrifice a nonland permanent: This creature deals 1 damage to any target.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *  - Two cost components joined by a comma are one [Costs.Composite]: the mana half is
 *    `Costs.Mana("{1}")` and the sacrifice half is a [Costs.Sacrifice] over
 *    [GameObjectFilter.NonlandPermanent] — the filter whose card predicates are exactly the
 *    `IsNonland` + `IsPermanent` pair Assay compiles this line to. The permanent is chosen and
 *    sacrificed on activation, before the ability goes on the stack.
 *  - A sacrifice cost can only ever take permanents its payer controls, so the filter carries no
 *    controller predicate — the cost atom's candidate domain is already scoped to the payer.
 *  - The printed line says "a nonland permanent", **not** "another": [Costs.Sacrifice] (not
 *    `SacrificeAnother`) leaves Magmaw itself in the candidate pool, so feeding Magmaw to its own
 *    ability is a legal activation. The damage still happens; last-known information covers the
 *    source having left the battlefield.
 *  - "any target" is [Targets.Any] — creature, player, planeswalker or battle — and the damage is
 *    a plain [Effects.DealDamage] with the source defaulting to this creature, matching the printed
 *    "This creature deals".
