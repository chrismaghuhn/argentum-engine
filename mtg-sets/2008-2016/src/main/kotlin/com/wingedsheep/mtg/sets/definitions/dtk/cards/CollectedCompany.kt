/**
 * Collected Company
 * {3}{G}
 * Instant
 *
 * Look at the top six cards of your library. Put up to two creature cards with mana value 3 or less from among them onto the battlefield. Put the rest on the bottom of your library in any order.
 *
 * Three printed sentences, one recipe: [Patterns.Library.lookAtTopAndTakeMatching] is exactly this
 * shape — look at the top six privately, take *up to two* of the cards that match
 * ([SelectionMode.ChooseUpTo] over creatures capped at mana value 3; the recipe shows every
 * looked-at card and only the matching ones are selectable), put those onto the battlefield, and
 * bottom the remainder. "In any order" is the caster's choice, so the rest go back under
 * [CardOrder.ControllerChooses] — not [CardOrder.Random], which is the *other* printed wording
 * (Cartographer's Survey).
