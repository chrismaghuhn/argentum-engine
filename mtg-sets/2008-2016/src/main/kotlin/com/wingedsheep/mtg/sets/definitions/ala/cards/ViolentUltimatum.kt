/**
 * Violent Ultimatum
 * {B}{B}{R}{R}{R}{G}{G}
 * Sorcery
 * Destroy three target permanents.
 *
 * The count lives entirely on the target requirement — one [TargetPermanent] with `count = 3` — and
 * the effect is fanned out over it with [ForEachTargetEffect], so each chosen permanent is destroyed
 * in its own iteration with [EffectTarget.ContextTarget] `(0)` bound to it. That keeps
 * indestructible and regeneration per-permanent (they are three separate [Effects.Destroy]
 * applications, not one group destroy) and means the number of targets is owned by the requirement
 * rather than duplicated on the effect.
