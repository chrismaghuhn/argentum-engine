/**
 * Fleshformer
 * {2}{B}
 * Creature — Human Wizard
 * 2 / 2
 * {W}{U}{B}{R}{G}: This creature gets +2/+2 and gains fear until end of turn. Target creature
 * gets -2/-2 until end of turn. Activate only during your turn.
 *
 * One activated ability, not two: the whole printed block is a single {W}{U}{B}{R}{G} activation.
 * The effect keeps the printed sentence structure — the first sentence's two clauses ("gets +2/+2
 * *and* gains fear") are chained together and then composed with the second sentence's -2/-2, so
 * the self-pump and the target's shrink stay one atomic resolution. "This creature" is
 * [EffectTarget.Self]; only the -2/-2 half takes a target. "Activate only during your turn" is
 * [ActivationRestriction.OnlyDuringYourTurn], which the activation-legality check reads — it is
 * not expressible as a timing rule.
