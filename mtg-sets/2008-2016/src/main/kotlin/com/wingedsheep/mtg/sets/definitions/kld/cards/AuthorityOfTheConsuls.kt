/**
 * Authority of the Consuls

 * Enchantment
 *
 * Creatures your opponents control enter tapped.
 * Whenever a creature an opponent controls enters, you gain 1 life.
 *
 * - "Creatures your opponents control enter tapped" is a global [PermanentsEnterTapped] runtime
 *   replacement (the group counterpart of the self-only `EntersTapped`) whose `appliesTo` filter
 *   describes the *affected* permanents — creatures an opponent of Authority's controller controls.
 *   The controller-relative `opponentControls()` predicate is resolved against Authority's own
 *   controller at entry time.
 * - The gain-life clause is an ANY-binding enters trigger over the same opponent-creature filter;
 *   it fires once per opponent creature that enters (tokens included).
