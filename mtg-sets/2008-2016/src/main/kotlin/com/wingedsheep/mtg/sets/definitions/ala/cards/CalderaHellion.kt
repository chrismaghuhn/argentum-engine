/**
 * Caldera Hellion
 * {3}{R}{R}
 * Creature — Hellion
 * 3 / 3
 * Devour 1 (As this creature enters, you may sacrifice any number of creatures. It enters with that many +1/+1 counters on it.)
 * When this creature enters, it deals 3 damage to each creature.
 *
 * Devour is two declarations, not one: [KeywordAbility.devour] gives the printed line (and the
 * keyword the rest of the engine reads), while the [EntersWithDevour] replacement effect is what
 * actually offers the sacrifice and stamps the +1/+1 counters as the creature enters — its defaults
 * are the plain creature filter and the unnamed variant, exactly the printed "devour 1". The sweep
 * clause is a plain `Triggers.self.enters()` over
 * [Effects.ForEachInGroup] of every creature — including the Hellion itself, which is why it usually
 * eats its own devour counters — with [DealDamageEffect] bound to [EffectTarget.IterationEntity], the
 * per-iteration member.
