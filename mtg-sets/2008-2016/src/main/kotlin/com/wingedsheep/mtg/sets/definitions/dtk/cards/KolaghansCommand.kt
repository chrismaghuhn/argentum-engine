/**
 * Kolaghan's Command
 * {1}{B}{R}
 * Instant
 *
 * Choose two —
 * • Return target creature card from your graveyard to your hand.
 * • Target player discards a card.
 * • Destroy target artifact.
 * • Kolaghan's Command deals 2 damage to any target.
 *
 * "Choose two —" over four modes is `modal(chooseCount = 2)` — two *different* modes, since the
 * card carries no "you may choose the same mode more than once" rider.
 *
 * Three of the four modes target, and each targets something different, so the targets are declared
 * *inside* their modes (the block form of `mode`): only the chosen modes' requirements are asked
 * for, which is what CR 601.2c means by choosing targets after choosing modes.
 *
 * The graveyard return writes the plain [Effects.ReturnToHand] with no `fromZone` guard: the
 * requirement's own `zone = GRAVEYARD` is re-checked at resolution under CR 608.2b, so a card
 * exiled in response is already an illegal target.
