/**
 * Decorated Griffin
 * {4}{W}
 * Creature — Griffin
 * 2 / 3
 *
 * Flying
 * {1}{W}: Prevent the next 1 combat damage that would be dealt to you this turn.
 *
 * The shield's recipient is the controller — [Effects.PreventDamage]'s default `target` — so "dealt
 * to you" is the absence of a target, not a target of its own. Keeping the amount non-null is
 * load-bearing: an amount-less combat-only shield on the default target is what
 * `PreventDamageExecutor` reads as the global Fog.
