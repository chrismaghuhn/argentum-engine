/**
 * Primeval Bounty
 * {5}{G}
 * Enchantment
 *
 * Whenever you cast a creature spell, create a 3/3 green Beast creature token.
 * Whenever you cast a noncreature spell, put three +1/+1 counters on target creature you control.
 * Landfall — Whenever a land you control enters, you gain 3 life.
 *
 * Oracle note: original M14 wording said "Whenever a land enters the battlefield under
 * your control, you gain 3 life." Current Oracle text (post-Foundations) renames this to
 * a Landfall keyword ability — same mechanical behavior, so a single triggered-ability
 * implementation is used here.
