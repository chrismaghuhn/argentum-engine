/**
 * Red Sun's Zenith — Mirrodin Besieged #74 (canonical / earliest real printing, 2011)
 * {X}{R} · Sorcery
 *
 * Red Sun's Zenith deals X damage to any target. If a creature dealt damage this way would die
 * this turn, exile it instead. Shuffle Red Sun's Zenith into its owner's library.
 *
 * Carbonize's shape plus a gate: `AnyTarget()` and [Effects.MarkExileOnDeath], the CR 614 death
 * replacement that lasts the turn. The mark goes on *before* the damage, as on Carbonize, so a
 * creature killed by this very spell is exiled rather than merely a creature that survives it and
 * dies later.
 *
 * The gate is what Carbonize doesn't need. Carbonize deals a fixed 3, but this is an {X} spell and
 * X = 0 is a legal, {R}-cheap cast — and CR 120.8 says a source that would deal 0 damage deals none
 * at all. With no creature "dealt damage this way" there is nothing to exile, so an ungated mark
 * would quietly exile a creature that died to something else later in the turn. `X > 0` is the
 * condition the card's own wording implies.
 *
 * Not gated on the target being a creature: marking a player is a no-op in the executor, and
 * marking a planeswalker is a no-op because the loyalty state-based action never consults the
 * marker — "a creature dealt damage this way" is the only thing the clause speaks to.
