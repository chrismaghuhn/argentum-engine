/**
 * Slum Reaper
 * {3}{B}
 * Creature — Horror
 * 4/2
 *
 * When this creature enters, each player sacrifices a creature of their choice.
 *
 * Canonical printing: Return to Ravnica, the card's earliest real printing.
 *
 * "Each player sacrifices" names a player, so it is [Effects.Sacrifice]'s three-argument form —
 * a `ForceSacrificeEffect` — and not the bare imperative that makes the *controller* sacrifice.
 * The Reaper's own controller is included, and may well have to feed it the Reaper.
