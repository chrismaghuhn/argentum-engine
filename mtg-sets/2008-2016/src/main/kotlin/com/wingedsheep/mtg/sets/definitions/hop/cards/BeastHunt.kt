/**
 * Beast Hunt
 * {3}{G}
 * Sorcery
 * Reveal the top three cards of your library. Put all creature cards revealed this way into your hand and the rest into your graveyard.
 *
 * Canonical printing: Planechase (2009) is Beast Hunt's earliest real printing — it predates the
 * Zendikar printing by a month.
 *
 * The remainder goes to the graveyard rather than the pattern's default bottom-of-library. The
 * printed line names no order for it, so the cards keep their gather order ([CardOrder.Preserve])
 * rather than the pattern's bottom-of-library default of a random shuffle.
