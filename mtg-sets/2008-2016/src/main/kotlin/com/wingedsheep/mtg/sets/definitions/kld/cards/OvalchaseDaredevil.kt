/**
 * Ovalchase Daredevil
 * {3}{B}
 * Creature — Human Pilot
 * 4/2
 *
 * Whenever an artifact you control enters, you may return this card from your graveyard to your
 * hand.
 *
 * The ability functions from the graveyard, not the battlefield (CR 113.6b), so the trigger is
 * zone-scoped with `triggerZone = Zone.GRAVEYARD`; without it the trigger would only be indexed
 * while the Daredevil is on the battlefield, where the ability can never do anything.
 * `binding = TriggerBinding.ANY` is what makes the entering artifact — rather than the source —
 * the triggering entity.
