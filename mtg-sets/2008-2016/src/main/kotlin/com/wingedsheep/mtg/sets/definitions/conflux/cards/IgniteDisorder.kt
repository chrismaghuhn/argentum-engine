/**
 * Ignite Disorder
 * {1}{R}
 * Instant
 * Ignite Disorder deals 3 damage divided as you choose among one, two, or three target white
 * and/or blue creatures.
 *
 * The Arc Lightning shape: **one** target requirement with `count = 3, minCount = 1` plus a
 * [DividedDamageEffect], not three separate targets — the engine reads the requirement's range to
 * ask for a damage distribution at cast time and validates that every chosen target gets at least
 * one damage. "White and/or blue" is a single noun phrase, so it is one filter:
 * [GameObjectFilter.withAnyColor] unions the two colours into a single `Or` predicate rather than
 * two independent clauses.
