/**
 * Faerie Mechanist
 * {3}{U}
 * Artifact Creature — Faerie Artificer
 * 2 / 2
 * Flying
 * When this creature enters, look at the top three cards of your library. You may reveal an
 * artifact card from among them and put it into your hand. Put the rest on the bottom of your
 * library in any order.
 *
 * The dig is the shared [Patterns.Library.lookAtTopRevealMatchingToHand] recipe — Glint-Nest
 * Crane with a three-card pile. The pattern already supplies the optional single pick, the
 * artifact filter as an unselectable-but-visible mask over all three cards, the reveal as the
 * kept card moves to hand, and the bottom-of-library destination for the remainder; "in any
 * order" is the non-default [CardOrder.ControllerChooses].
