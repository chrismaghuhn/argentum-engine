/**
 * Vigilante Justice
 * {3}{R}
 * Enchantment
 *
 * Whenever a Human you control enters, this enchantment deals 1 damage to any target.
 *
 * "A Human you control" is a bare tribal noun with no "creature" beside it, so the filter is
 * [GameObjectFilter.Permanent] with the subtype — a Human artifact or a Human enchantment creature
 * token both count. The binding is ANY rather than OTHER because the printed text says "a Human",
 * not "another Human"; the enchantment itself can never be the permanent that entered, so the two
 * differ only in principle here, but the principle is what the wording states.
