/**
 * Splendid Reclamation — Eldritch Moon #171
 * {3}{G} · Sorcery
 *
 * Return all land cards from your graveyard to the battlefield tapped.
 *
 * The Aftermath Analyst / Lumra, Bellow of the Woods shape as a bare spell: gather every land card
 * in the controller's graveyard into one collection, then move that whole collection to the
 * battlefield with [ZonePlacement.Tapped]. Gathering first is what makes "all land cards" a single
 * snapshot taken on resolution — nothing is re-scanned between the individual moves, so a land that
 * somehow leaves the graveyard mid-move can't be returned twice and one that arrives mid-move isn't
 * picked up.
 *
 * "Return … to the battlefield" is not targeted, so nothing here is chosen at cast time and the
 * spell resolves even if the graveyard is empty (a no-op). The returned lands enter under their
 * *owner's* control by default — which for a graveyard is the same player as the controller here,
 * since a card in a graveyard is always in its owner's graveyard (CR 404.1).
