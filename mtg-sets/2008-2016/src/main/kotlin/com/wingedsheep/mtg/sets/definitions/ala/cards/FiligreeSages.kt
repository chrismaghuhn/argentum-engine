 * Artifact Creature — Vedalken Wizard
 * 2 / 3
 * {2}{U}: Untap target artifact.
 *
 * A single mana-only activated ability — no tap in the cost, so it can be used repeatedly and on
 * the Sages themselves. [Effects.Untap] over a [TargetPermanent] filtered to artifacts; the
 * battlefield filter reads projected state, so a permanent that is only *currently* an artifact
 * (an animated Vedalken Shackles, say) is a legal target.
