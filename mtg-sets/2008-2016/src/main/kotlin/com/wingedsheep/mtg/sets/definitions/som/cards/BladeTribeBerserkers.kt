/**
 * Blade-Tribe Berserkers
 * {3}{R}
 * Creature — Human Berserker
 * 3/3
 *
 * Metalcraft — When this creature enters, if you control three or more artifacts, this creature gets +3/+3 and gains haste until end of turn.
 *
 * "Metalcraft" is an ability word (CR 207.2c) with no rules meaning of its own — there is no
 * `Keyword.METALCRAFT`, and nothing but the oracle line records it. What the line actually is:
 * an ETB trigger whose printed "if …" clause is an intervening-if condition
 * ([Conditions.YouControlAtLeast]), checked both when the trigger would go on the stack and again
 * as it resolves (CR 603.4).
