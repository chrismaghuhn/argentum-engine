/**
 * Mardu Blazebringer
 * {2}{R}
 * Creature — Ogre Warrior
 * 4/4
 * When Mardu Blazebringer attacks or blocks, sacrifice it at end of combat.
 *
 * One printed sentence, two triggered abilities: a creature can never both attack and block in one
 * combat, so the disjunction fires at most once either way, and this is the spelling the corpus
 * writes 60 times against three for `EventPattern.AnyOf`. The sacrifice is `SacrificeSelfEffect` —
 * the verb with no object, which reads the delayed trigger's own source — rather than
 * `SacrificeTarget(Self)`; the two are behaviourally identical and Argentum Assay reads the printed
 * line as the former, so the card carries the spelling the grammar prints.
