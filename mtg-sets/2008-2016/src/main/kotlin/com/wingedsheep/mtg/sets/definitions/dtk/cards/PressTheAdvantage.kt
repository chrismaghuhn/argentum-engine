/**
 * Press the Advantage
 * {2}{G}{G}
 * Instant
 *
 * Up to two target creatures each get +2/+2 and gain trample until end of turn.
 *
 * "Up to two target creatures **each**" is a `count = 2` requirement, and a `target()` handle on a
 * multi-target requirement resolves to nothing — the bound variable names the requirement, not one
 * chosen target. The corpus shape is [ForEachTargetEffect] over `ContextTarget(0)`: the loop rebinds
 * the context to one chosen target per iteration, so the pump and the grant both land on each
 * creature. The declared requirement is therefore not captured; only its registration matters.
