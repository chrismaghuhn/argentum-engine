/**
 * Volcanic Submersion

 * Sorcery
 * Destroy target artifact or land.
 * Cycling {2} ({2}, Discard this card: Draw a card.)
 *
 * The spell half is one named target over [Targets.ArtifactOrLand] — the shared "artifact or land"
 * union filter, not a hand-rolled `Or` — consumed by [Effects.Destroy], which is the
 * `byDestruction` move to the graveyard so indestructible and regeneration still apply. Cycling is
 * declared as [KeywordAbility.cycling], which carries its own cost and lowers to the discard-and-draw
 * activated ability; no `keywords(...)` entry is needed alongside it.
