/**
 * Esper Charm
 * {W}{U}{B}
 * Instant
 * Choose one —
 * • Destroy target enchantment.
 * • Draw two cards.
 * • Target player discards two cards.
 *
 * The Alara charm cycle: a `modal(chooseCount = 1)` block whose three modes each own their own
 * targets, so only the chosen mode's target is picked on the stack. Mode one is [Effects.Destroy]
 * (a graveyard move flagged `byDestruction`, so indestructible and regeneration still apply); mode
 * two is a bare [Effects.DrawCards]; mode three is [Patterns.Hand].discardCards pointed at the
 * targeted player — the gather → select → move pipeline, with the *target* doing the choosing.
