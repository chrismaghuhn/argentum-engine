/**
 * Tribute to Hunger
 * {2}{B}
 * Instant
 *
 * Target opponent sacrifices a creature of their choice. You gain life equal to that creature's toughness.
 *
 * The edict records the sacrificed permanent's last-known snapshot in the effect context, so the
 * downstream [Effects.GainLife] reads [DynamicAmounts.sacrificedToughness] for the creature the
 * opponent chose — even after it has left the battlefield. If the opponent controls no creatures,
 * nothing is sacrificed and no life is gained.
 *
 * Canonical printing lives in Innistrad (the card's earliest real printing); Foundations contributes
 * only a [com.wingedsheep.sdk.model.Printing] row.
