/**
 * Oxidda Scrapmelter — Scars of Mirrodin #101
 * {3}{R} · Creature — Beast · 3 / 3
 *
 * When this creature enters, destroy target artifact.
 *
 * A plain SELF-bound `Triggers.self.enters()` over [Effects.Destroy]. The trigger is not
 * optional and its target is not "up to", so it must pick an artifact if one is on the battlefield
 * — including one of yours when the opponent has none. `Destroy` lowers to a graveyard move flagged
 * `byDestruction`, which is what lets indestructible and regeneration see it.
