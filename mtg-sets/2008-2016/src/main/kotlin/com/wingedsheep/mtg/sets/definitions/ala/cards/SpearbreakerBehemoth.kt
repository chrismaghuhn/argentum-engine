 * {1}: Target creature with power 5 or greater gains indestructible until end of turn.
 *
 * The Rakeclaw Gargantuan shape with its own keyword to hand out: the power threshold is a filter
 * on the target itself — [TargetFilter.Creature]`.powerAtLeast(5)` — so legality is checked on
 * announcement and rechecked on resolution, and the grant is [Effects.GrantKeyword] on the bound
 * target with its default `Duration.EndOfTurn`. The Behemoth's own indestructibility is the
 * printed [Keyword.INDESTRUCTIBLE], separate from the ability.
