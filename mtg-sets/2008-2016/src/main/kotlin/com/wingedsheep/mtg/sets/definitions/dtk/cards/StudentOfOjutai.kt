 * Student of Ojutai

 * Creature — Human Monk
 * 2 / 4
 *
 * Whenever you cast a noncreature spell, you gain 2 life.
 *
 * The Monk shell without prowess: the printed line is a bare `Triggers.you.casts(GameObjectFilter.Noncreature)` trigger
 * whose effect is life gain, so `prowess()` would be wrong — it would add a +1/+1 trigger the card
 * doesn't have. `Effects.GainLife` defaults to the controller, which is the printed "you".
