/**
 * Ballista Charger
 * {5}
 * Artifact — Vehicle
 * 6/6
 * Whenever this Vehicle attacks, it deals 1 damage to any target.
 * Crew 3 (Tap any number of creatures you control with total power 3 or more: This Vehicle becomes
 * an artifact creature until end of turn.)
 *
 * "This Vehicle" is the source, so the attack trigger is the plain `Triggers.self.attacks()` with an
 * [Targets.Any] slot and no explicit damage source — the engine already attributes the damage to
 * the ability's source. Crew is the engine-owned [KeywordAbility.crew] ability.
