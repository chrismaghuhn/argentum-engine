/**
 * Bloodbraid Elf
 * {2}{R}{G}
 * Creature — Elf Berserker
 * 3/2
 * Haste (This creature can attack and {T} as soon as it comes under your control.)
 * Cascade (When you cast this spell, exile cards from the top of your library until you exile a nonland card that costs less. You may cast it without paying its mana cost. Put the exiled cards on the bottom in a random order.)
 *
 * Haste is a plain keyword, but [Keyword.CASCADE] is display-only — nothing in the rules engine
 * reads it. Cascade is itself a "when you cast this spell" triggered ability (CR 702.85a), so the
 * behavior lives in the `Triggers.self.isCast()` trigger feeding [Effects.Cascade], with the
 * keyword kept only for the printed line — the same shape as `cmr/cards/AnnoyedAltisaur.kt`.
