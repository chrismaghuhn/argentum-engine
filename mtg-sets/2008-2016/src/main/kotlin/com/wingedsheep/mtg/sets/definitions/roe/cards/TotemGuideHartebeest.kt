/**
 * Totem-Guide Hartebeest
 * {4}{W}
 * Creature — Antelope
 * 2 / 5
 *
 * When this creature enters, you may search your library for an Aura card, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *  - "**When** this creature enters" is the one-shot `Triggers.self.enters()`.
 *  - "You **may** search" is a decline on resolution, so `optional = true` lowers the tutor into a
 *    `Gate.MayDecide` — the `Gated` wrapper Assay compiles from this line. It is not a `ChooseUpTo`
 *    "find nothing": that selection freedom is separate, and both are present.
 *  - The search itself is the stock [Patterns.Library.searchLibrary] recipe rather than a
 *    hand-rolled composite — with `destination = HAND` and `reveal = true` it expands to exactly
 *    Assay's Gather → Select(ChooseUpTo 1) → Move(Hand, revealed) → Shuffle → `LibrarySearchedEvent`
 *    chain, and `shuffleAfter` already defaults to true, which is the printed "then shuffle".
 *  - The filter is [Subtype.AURA] alone, with no `IsEnchantment` predicate beside it. Every Aura is
 *    an enchantment, so the narrower filter would select the same cards — but the printed text
 *    restricts by subtype and nothing else, and the extra type predicate is a divergence the Assay
 *    differential flags against the model built from that same text.
