 * "Artifact creature" is one noun phrase and so one filter — the shared
 * [GameObjectFilter.ArtifactCreature] (both predicates required, an `And`), never an `Or` union.
 * [Effects.Destroy] is the `byDestruction` move to the graveyard, so indestructible and
 * regeneration still apply. Cycling is [KeywordAbility.cycling], which carries its own cost.
