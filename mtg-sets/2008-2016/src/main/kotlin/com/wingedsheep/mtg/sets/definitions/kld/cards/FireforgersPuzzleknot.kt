/**
 * Fireforger's Puzzleknot
 * {2}
 * Artifact
 *
 * When this artifact enters, it deals 1 damage to any target.
 * {2}{R}, Sacrifice this artifact: It deals 1 damage to any target.
 *
 * The same one-damage effect twice, reached two ways: once for free on arrival and once for
 * {2}{R} plus the artifact itself. The activated half composes [Costs.Mana] with
 * [Costs.SacrificeSelf], so the sacrifice is part of paying the cost — it happens on activation,
 * not on resolution, and the damage is still dealt after the Puzzleknot is gone.
