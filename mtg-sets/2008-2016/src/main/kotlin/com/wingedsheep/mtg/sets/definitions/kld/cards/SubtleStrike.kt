/**
 * Subtle Strike
 * {1}{B}
 * Instant
 *
 * Choose one or both —
 * • Target creature gets -1/-1 until end of turn.
 * • Put a +1/+1 counter on target creature.
 *
 * "Choose one or both" is the modal *count*, not a third mode: `chooseCount = 2` with
 * `minChooseCount = 1` (CR 700.2). Each mode carries its own target, so picking both asks for two
 * creatures — which may be the same creature twice, since the requirements are independent.
