/**
 * Kaalia of the Vast
 * {1}{R}{W}{B}
 * Legendary Creature — Human Cleric
 * 2/2
 *
 * Flying
 * Whenever Kaalia of the Vast attacks an opponent, you may put an Angel, Demon, or Dragon
 * creature card from your hand onto the battlefield tapped and attacking that opponent.
 *
 * Engine notes:
 * - "attacks an opponent" is the whole reason for engine feature #1258. A creature can be
 *   declared as attacking a player, a planeswalker, or a battle (CR 508.1); Kaalia's ability
 *   fires only for the *player* case. The 2024-06-07 ruling makes this explicit: "Kaalia's
 *   ability doesn't trigger if it attacks a planeswalker or battle." That gate is
 *   `Triggers.self.attacks(setOf(AttackPredicate.DefenderIsPlayer))` (SELF + `AttackPredicate.DefenderIsPlayer`), NOT the
 *   unfiltered `Triggers.self.attacks()`.
 * - "put an Angel, Demon, or Dragon creature card from your hand ... tapped and attacking"
 *   reuses `Patterns.Hand.putFromHand(entersAttacking = true)`: GatherCards (hand) →
 *   SelectFromCollection (ChooseUpTo 1 = "you may") → MoveCollection with
 *   `ZonePlacement.TappedAndAttacking`, which adds the `AttackingComponent` against the
 *   defending player. The subtype gate is
 *   `GameObjectFilter.Creature.withAnySubtype("Angel", "Demon", "Dragon")`.
 * - "that opponent": the two-player engine has a single opponent, and the tapped-and-attacking
 *   placement attacks the first opponent in turn order — i.e. the player Kaalia attacked. The
 *   multiplayer "that opponent" nuance is a pre-existing shared limitation of the
 *   entersAttacking pipeline, not specific to Kaalia.
