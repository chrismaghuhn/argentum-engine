 * The three printed cost atoms compose through [Costs.Composite] — [Costs.Mana], [Costs.Tap] and
 * [Costs.SacrificeSelf] — and the target is a [TargetObject] over
 * [TargetFilter.ArtifactInYourGraveyard], the same shape Sharuum the
 * Hegemon uses. The recursion is [Effects.PutOntoBattlefieldFromGraveyard], the `fromZone`-guarded
 * sibling of `PutOntoBattlefield`, so the move is skipped if the card has left the graveyard by the
 * time the ability resolves.
