/**
 * Blood-Chin Rager
 * {1}{B}
 * Creature — Human Warrior
 * 2 / 2
 *
 * Whenever this creature attacks, Warrior creatures you control gain menace until end of turn. (They can't be blocked except by two or more creatures.)
 *
 * The printed noun is "Warrior **creatures**", so the group is the creature filter narrowed by
 * subtype — `AllCreaturesYouControl.withSubtype("Warrior")` — not a bare permanent-with-subtype
 * group. One sentence names its group once, so this is a single
 * [Patterns.Group.grantKeywordToAll] pass (`ForEach` over the group, granting menace to each
 * member) rather than a hand-rolled pipeline; the until-end-of-turn duration is that facade's
 * default.
