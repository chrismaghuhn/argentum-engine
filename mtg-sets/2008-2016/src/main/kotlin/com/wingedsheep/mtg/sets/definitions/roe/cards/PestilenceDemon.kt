/**
 * Pestilence Demon
 * {5}{B}{B}{B}
 * Creature — Demon
 * 7 / 6
 *
 * Flying
 * {B}: This creature deals 1 damage to each creature and each player.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *  - "Each creature and each player" is **two iterations, not one**: a group pass over every
 *    creature ([Effects.ForEachInGroup] with [EffectTarget.IterationEntity] naming the current iteration
 *    entity) and a player pass where each iteration rebinds the controller
 *    ([Effects.ForEachPlayer] over [Player.Each] with [EffectTarget.Controller]). Same idiom as
 *    Thrashing Wumpus, whose printed line is identical, and the same shape Assay compiles.
 *  - The creature filter is bare [GameObjectFilter.Creature] with no controller predicate — this
 *    hits *every* creature, including the Demon itself and your own board.
 *  - Nothing is targeted, so no `target(...)` requirement is declared; the ability can be activated
 *    with an empty battlefield.
