/**
 * Trigon of Corruption — Scars of Mirrodin #213
 * {4} · Artifact
 *
 * This artifact enters with three charge counters on it.
 * {B}{B}, {T}: Put a charge counter on this artifact.
 * {2}, {T}, Remove a charge counter from this artifact: Put a -1/-1 counter on target creature.
 *
 * The charge counters are a battery, not a clock: [EntersWithCounters] loads three at entry, the
 * first ability recharges one at a time, and the second spends one. Both abilities tap, so the
 * Trigon fires at most once a turn and recharging costs it that turn's shot.
 *
 * The removal is [Costs.RemoveCounterFromSelf] — a self-scoped counter atom rather than a
 * filtered "from among permanents you control" one, so there is nothing for the player to choose
 * and the ability is simply unactivatable at zero charge counters.
