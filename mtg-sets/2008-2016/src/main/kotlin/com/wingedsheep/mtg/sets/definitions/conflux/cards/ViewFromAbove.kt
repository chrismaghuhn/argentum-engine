 * View from Above to its owner's hand.
 *
 * Two sentences chained with `then`. The rider is a [Gate.WhenCondition] — a state check taken
 * when View from Above *resolves*, not an intervening-if, so a white permanent that arrives after
 * the spell was cast still counts. The condition is the general
 * [Exists] over your battlefield with a bare "white permanent" filter (`IsPermanent` +
 * `HasColor(WHITE)`), and the return moves [EffectTarget.Self] — the spell itself, which is still
 * on the stack — to [Zone.HAND] rather than the targeted creature.
