/**
 * Cudgel Troll
 * {2}{G}{G}
 * Creature — Troll
 * 4/3
 *
 * {G}: Regenerate this creature. (The next time this creature would be destroyed this turn, instead
 * tap it, remove it from combat, and heal all damage on it.)
 *
 * - "Regenerate this creature" is [RegenerateEffect] on [EffectTarget.Self] — a replacement shield
 *   over the next destruction this turn, not damage prevention. There is no `Effects.Regenerate`
 *   facade; the effect class is the shipped spelling (Cinderbones, Marrow Bats, Kin-Tree Warden).
 * - The reminder text is printed on the card and kept verbatim in the oracle text.
