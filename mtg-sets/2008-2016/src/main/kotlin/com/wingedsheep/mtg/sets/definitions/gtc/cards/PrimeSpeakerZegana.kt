/**
 * Prime Speaker Zegana — GTC #188
 * Legendary Creature — Merfolk Wizard (1/1), Mythic
 *
 * Prime Speaker Zegana enters with X +1/+1 counters on it, where X is the greatest power among
 *   other creatures you control.
 * When Prime Speaker Zegana enters, draw cards equal to its power.
 *
 * X is an entry-replacement (`EntersWithDynamicCounters`), so it is computed once as Zegana
 * enters and `excludeSelf = true` keeps her own 1 power out of the max — a creature entering
 * simultaneously isn't counted either, since it isn't on the battlefield when the replacement
 * evaluates. The draw trigger reads the source's *projected* power, which already includes the
 * counters she entered with, and falls back to last-known information if she has left the
 * battlefield before the trigger resolves.
