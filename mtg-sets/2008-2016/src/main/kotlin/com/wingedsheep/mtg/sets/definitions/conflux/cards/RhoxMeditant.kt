/**
 * Rhox Meditant
 * {3}{W}
 * Creature — Rhino Monk
 * 2/4
 * When this creature enters, if you control a green permanent, draw a card.
 *
 * The "if" is an intervening-if clause (CR 603.4), not a condition on the effect: it is checked
 * both when the trigger would go on the stack and again on resolution, which is what
 * `interveningIf` means here rather than folding the check into the effect. The check itself is
 * [Conditions.YouControl] over `GameObjectFilter.Permanent.withColor(GREEN)` — a bare "permanent"
 * noun, so no creature narrowing.
