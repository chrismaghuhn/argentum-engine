/**
 * Kor Line-Slinger
 * {1}{W}
 * Creature — Kor Scout
 * 0 / 1
 *
 * {T}: Tap target creature with power 3 or less.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *  - The whole cost is the tap symbol — [Costs.Tap], Assay's bare `CostTap` — so the ability is
 *    once per turn and subject to summoning sickness (CR 302.6), with no mana component.
 *  - "Target creature with power 3 or less" is [Targets.CreatureWithPowerAtMost], which builds the
 *    `Creature.powerAtMost(3)` filter — Assay's `IsCreature` + `PowerAtMost(max: 3)` pair. Power is
 *    read off *projected* state, so a creature pumped past 3 in response stops being a legal target
 *    and the ability fizzles.
 *  - The tap is [Effects.Tap] on the declared target; targeting an already-tapped creature is legal
 *    and simply does nothing, so no untapped restriction is written into the filter.
