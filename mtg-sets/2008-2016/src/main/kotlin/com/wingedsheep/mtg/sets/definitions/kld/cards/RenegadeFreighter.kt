/**
 * Renegade Freighter
 * {3}
 * Artifact — Vehicle
 * 4/3
 * Whenever this Vehicle attacks, it gets +1/+1 and gains trample until end of turn.
 * Crew 2 (Tap any number of creatures you control with total power 2 or more: This Vehicle becomes
 * an artifact creature until end of turn.)
 *
 * "This Vehicle" is just the source, so the attack trigger is the SELF-bound `Triggers.self.attacks()`
 * and both halves of its effect point at [EffectTarget.Self]. Crew is the engine's own
 * [KeywordAbility.crew] activated ability; the printed 4 / 3 only matters once it is crewed.
