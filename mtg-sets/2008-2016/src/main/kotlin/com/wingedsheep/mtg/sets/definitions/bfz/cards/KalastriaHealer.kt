/**
 * Kalastria Healer
 * {1}{B}
 * Creature — Vampire Cleric Ally
 * 1/2
 * Rally — Whenever this creature or another Ally you control enters, each opponent loses 1 life and you gain 1 life.
 *
 * Rally is an ability word, not a keyword: the trigger is an ANY-bound enters trigger over
 * Allies you control, so the creature's own arrival fires it alongside every later Ally.
 *
 * "Each opponent loses 1 life and you gain 1 life" is a composite of the two halves, not
 * [Effects.DrainLife] — the life you gain is a printed 1, not the life lost this way.
