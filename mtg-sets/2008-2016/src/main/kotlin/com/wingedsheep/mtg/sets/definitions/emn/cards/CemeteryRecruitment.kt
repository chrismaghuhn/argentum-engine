 * Canonical printing lives here in Eldritch Moon (earliest real printing); Foundations gets a

 *
 * The "if it's a Zombie card" bonus is checked against the target's printed types before it moves
 * (the target is still the graveyard card at resolution start, and its type is invariant across the
 * zone change), so the draw is folded into a [Effects.If] that gates the extra draw.
