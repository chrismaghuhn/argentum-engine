 * {4}
 * Artifact Creature — Construct
 * 5 / 6

 * Trample
 * When this creature attacks or blocks, sacrifice it at end of combat.
 *
 * One printed sentence, two triggered abilities — the same spelling Mardu Blazebringer uses. A
 * creature can never both attack and block in one combat, so the disjunction fires at most once
 * either way. The sacrifice is [SacrificeSelfEffect], the verb with no object that reads the
 * delayed trigger's own source.
