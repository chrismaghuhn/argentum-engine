/**
 * Akoum Boulderfoot
 * {4}{R}{R}
 * Creature — Giant Warrior
 * 4 / 5
 *
 * When this creature enters, it deals 1 damage to any target.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *  - "**When** this creature enters" is a one-shot `Triggers.self.enters()` on the card itself,
 *    not a `whenever another … enters` watcher — the printed word is "when", and the trigger binds
 *    to the source.
 *  - "Any target" is [Targets.Any] (creature, player, or planeswalker), matching Assay's
 *    `AnyTarget` requirement. The target is chosen as the ability goes on the stack, so it is a
 *    `target(...)` handle on the triggered ability rather than a resolution-time choice.
 *  - "**It** deals" — the damage source is the Boulderfoot, which is [Effects.DealDamage]'s default
 *    when no `damageSource` is passed, so the argument is omitted rather than restated.
