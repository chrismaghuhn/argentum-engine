 * Dreadwing
 * {B}
 * Creature — Zombie
 * 1 / 1
 * {1}{U}{R}: This creature gets +3/+0 and gains flying until end of turn.
 *
 * The two printed halves are one [Effects.Composite] — the pump and the keyword grant both point at
 * [EffectTarget.Self] and both take the facade default `Duration.EndOfTurn`, so "until end of turn"
 * needs no argument. The off-colour activation cost is why the colour identity runs wider than the
 * `{B}` mana cost. Same shape as Hyalopterous Lemure.
