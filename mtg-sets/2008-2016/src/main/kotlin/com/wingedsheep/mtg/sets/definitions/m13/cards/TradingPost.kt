/**
 * Trading Post
 * {4}
 * Artifact
 * {1}, {T}, Discard a card: You gain 4 life.
 * {1}, {T}, Pay 1 life: Create a 0 / 1 white Goat creature token.
 * {1}, {T}, Sacrifice a creature: Return target artifact card from your graveyard to your hand.
 * {1}, {T}, Sacrifice an artifact: Draw a card.
 *
 * Canonical printing: Magic 2013, the card's earliest printing. Reprinted in M14 as a `Printing`
 * row.
 *
 * Four separate activated abilities, each a [Costs.Composite] of `{1}`, the tap symbol, and one
 * additional cost. Only the third targets; the Goat token's art comes from the set's `tokenArt`
 * registry, never a baked `imageUri`.
