/**
 * Thought-Knot Seer
 * {3}{C}
 * Creature — Eldrazi
 * 4/4
 *
 * When this creature enters, target opponent reveals their hand. You choose a nonland card from
 * it and exile that card.
 * When this creature leaves the battlefield, target opponent draws a card.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *  - The ETB is `Patterns.Hand.revealHandAndExileChosen(target = opponent)` — the exact
 *    "reveal hand → choose a nonland → exile it" shape already used by Cruelclaw's Heist / Soul
 *    Search (Thoughtseize with exile instead of discard).
 *  - The LTB is a self `Triggers.self.leaves()` (Goblin Firebug's shape) with its own target
 *    opponent, drawing them a card as the "give it back" cost.
 *  - Canonical printing lives here (Oath of the Gatewatch, its earliest real-expansion printing
 *    per Scryfall — it was never printed in Battle for Zendikar).
