/**
 * Esper Battlemage
 * {2}{U}
 * Artifact Creature — Human Wizard
 * 2 / 2
 * {W}, {T}: Prevent the next 2 damage that would be dealt to you this turn.
 * {B}, {T}: Target creature gets -1/-1 until end of turn.
 *
 * The Alara battlemage cycle: two off-colour activated abilities sharing one tap. Both costs are a
 * [Costs.Composite] of a single coloured pip and [Costs.Tap], so only one may be used per turn.
 * "Dealt to you" is [Effects.PreventNextDamage] pointed at [EffectTarget.Controller] — a shield with
 * an amount rather than a scope, so it soaks any 2 damage from any source, combat or not, and needs
 * no target requirement. The black half is a plain [Effects.ModifyStats] whose `-1/-1` runs for the
 * default end-of-turn duration.
