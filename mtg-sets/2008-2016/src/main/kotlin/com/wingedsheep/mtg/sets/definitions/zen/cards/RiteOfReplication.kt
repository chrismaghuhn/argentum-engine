 * Create a token that's a copy of target creature. If this spell was kicked, create five

 *
 * "Create five … instead" is a mutually-exclusive branch, not additive: a kicked cast
 * makes five copies *and no more* (not five + the base one). Modeled as a
 * [Effects.If] on [Conditions.WasKicked] — the kicked branch creates five copies,
 * the else branch creates one. Each token is a copy of the resolved target creature via
 * `Effects.CreateTokenCopyOfTarget` (copiable characteristics per Rule 707); the copies'
 * own enters-the-battlefield triggers fire as they are created.
