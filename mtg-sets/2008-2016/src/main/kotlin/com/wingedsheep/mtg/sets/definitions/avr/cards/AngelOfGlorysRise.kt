/**
 * Angel of Glory's Rise — Avacyn Restored #1
 * {5}{W}{W} · Creature — Angel · 4/6
 *
 * Flying
 * When this creature enters, exile all Zombies, then return all Human creature cards from your
 * graveyard to the battlefield.
 *
 * The two halves are sequenced inside one [Effects.Composite] so the exile finishes before the
 * reanimation begins — a Human Zombie is exiled by the first half and therefore never seen by the
 * second, which is the printed ordering.
 *
 * "All Zombies" is a bare tribal noun, so it names *permanents* with the subtype (a Zombie
 * artifact or land counts), not only creatures; "Human creature cards" is explicit about the card
 * type and keeps [GameObjectFilter.Creature] as its base. The exile half is a per-permanent sweep
 * ([Effects.ForEachInGroup] with `EffectTarget.IterationEntity` bound to each member); the return half is the
 * gather → move pipeline the corpus writes for a mass graveyard return.
