/**
 * Demonic Pact
 * {2}{B}{B}
 * Enchantment
 * At the beginning of your upkeep, choose one that hasn't been chosen —
 * • This enchantment deals 4 damage to any target and you gain 4 life.
 * • Target opponent discards two cards.
 * • Draw two cards.
 * • You lose the game.
 *
 * Modelling notes:
 * - "Choose one that hasn't been chosen" is [ModalEffect.chooseOneNotYetChosen]: the mode memory is
 *   keyed to this specific permanent (CR 700.4 object identity), which matches the rulings — a
 *   second copy of Demonic Pact starts fresh, and a new controller inherits the modes already
 *   chosen rather than resetting them.
 * - The mode is picked as the triggered ability goes on the stack, and a chosen mode counts as
 *   chosen even if the ability later fizzles or is countered — both fall out of the shared modal
 *   machinery, which commits the pick at trigger-put-on-stack time.
 * - Once the first three modes are gone the fourth is the only legal pick, so the pact collects
 *   (the printed trap). If even that has been chosen the ability leaves the stack doing nothing.
