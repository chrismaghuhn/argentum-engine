 * Return target creature card from your graveyard to your hand.

 * The target requirement carries both halves of the noun phrase — the owner ("your graveyard")
 * and the zone — via [Targets.CreatureCardInYourGraveyard]. The move itself writes no `fromZone`
 * guard: a targeted graveyard-to-hand return is the unguarded [Effects.ReturnToHand], unlike the
 * graveyard-to-battlefield return, which keeps it.
