/**
 * Bala Ged Scorpion
 * {3}{B}
 * Creature — Scorpion
 * 2 / 3
 *
 * When this creature enters, you may destroy target creature with power 1 or less.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *  - Both halves of "you may destroy **target**" have to be present, and they happen at different
 *    times: the target is chosen when the trigger goes on the stack (so it is a `target(...)`
 *    handle on the ability, and CR 608.2b re-checks "power 1 or less" on resolution — pumping the
 *    creature in response fizzles the ability), while the "may" is a decline offered *on*
 *    resolution. `optional = true` is the authoring shorthand that lowers the effect into a
 *    `Gate.MayDecide`, which is exactly the `Gated` wrapper Assay compiles from this line.
 *  - "Creature with power 1 or less" is any creature on the battlefield — no "you control" is
 *    printed — so it is the unscoped [Targets.CreatureWithPowerAtMost] facade.
 *  - Plain [Effects.Destroy] (regeneration still allowed): the card says "destroy", not "destroy …
 *    it can't be regenerated".
