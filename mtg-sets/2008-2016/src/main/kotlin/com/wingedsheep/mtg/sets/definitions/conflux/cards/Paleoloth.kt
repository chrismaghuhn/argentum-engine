/**
 * Paleoloth
 * {4}{G}{G}
 * Creature — Beast
 * 5 / 5
 * Whenever another creature you control with power 5 or greater enters, you may return target creature card from your graveyard to your hand.
 *
 * The printed "another" is [TriggerBinding.OTHER] on a `Triggers.a(filter).enters()` whose filter
 * carries the whole restriction — creature, power 5 or greater, controlled by you — so the power
 * test is read off projected state when the permanent enters rather than baked into a condition.
 * Paleoloth is itself a 5/5, which is exactly why the binding matters: under `SELF`/`ANY` it would
 * recur a card off its own arrival. The printed "you may" is `optional = true`
 * (a `Gate.MayDecide` around the recursion), and the target is the prebuilt
 * [Targets.CreatureCardInYourGraveyard] — owned by you, in the graveyard zone.
