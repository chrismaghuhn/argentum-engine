 * The printed cost is two atoms in one line, so it is a [Costs.Composite] of the mana payment and
 * the tap symbol. "Without flying" is a *targeting* restriction rather than anything the effect
 * checks, so it lives on the target filter and is re-checked against projected state both on
 * activation and on resolution (cf. Merfolk Seastalkers, Flood).
