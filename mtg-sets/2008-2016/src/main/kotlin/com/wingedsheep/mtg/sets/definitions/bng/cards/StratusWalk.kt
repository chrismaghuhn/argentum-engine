/**
 * Stratus Walk
 * {1}{U}
 * Enchantment — Aura
 *
 * Enchant creature
 * When this Aura enters, draw a card.
 * Enchanted creature has flying. (It can't be blocked except by creatures with flying or reach.)
 * Enchanted creature can block only creatures with flying.
 *
 * The block restriction is a separate static from the flying grant — it constrains what the host
 * may block rather than granting it anything, so the two cannot fold into one ability. Its `filter`
 * must be spelled [GroupFilter.attachedCreature]: `CanOnlyBlockCreaturesWith` defaults to
 * `GroupFilter.source()`, which on an Aura is the Aura itself — an enchantment that never blocks,
 * so the restriction would silently do nothing and the enchanted creature would keep blocking
 * anything.
