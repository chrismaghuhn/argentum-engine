/**
 * Flame Slash
 * {R}
 * Sorcery
 *
 * Flame Slash deals 4 damage to target creature.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *  - The plainest burn shape there is: one cast-time creature target, one fixed-amount
 *    [Effects.DealDamage] pointed at it. Assay compiles exactly this — a `DealDamage` with a
 *    `Fixed` amount of 4 over a single `TargetObject` whose only predicate is `IsCreature` — so
 *    `Targets.Creature` is the filter, with no "you control" or other scoping the card doesn't print.
 *  - The damage source is left implicit (the spell itself), which is what the printed
 *    "Flame Slash deals" means; no `damageSource` override is needed.
