/**
 * Reckless Fireweaver
 * {1}{R}
 * Creature — Human Artificer
 * 1/3
 * Whenever an artifact you control enters, this creature deals 1 damage to each opponent.
 *
 * The Weldfast Wingsmith trigger shape — `Triggers.a(filter).enters()` over
 * `Artifact.youControl()` with [TriggerBinding.ANY], so it watches every artifact rather than only
 * the source. "Each opponent" is a single [EffectTarget.PlayerRef] over [Player.EachOpponent];
 * the damage source defaults to the ability's own source, so no `damageSource` is spelled here.
