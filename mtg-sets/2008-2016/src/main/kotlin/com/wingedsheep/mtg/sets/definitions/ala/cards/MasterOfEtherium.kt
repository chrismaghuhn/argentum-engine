/**
 * Master of Etherium
 * {2}{U}
 * Artifact Creature — Vedalken Wizard
 * * / *
 * Master of Etherium's power and toughness are each equal to the number of artifacts you control.
 * Other artifact creatures you control get +1/+1.
 *
 * Two halves that must not be confused. The P/T is a characteristic-defining ability (CR 604.3):
 * `dynamicStats` over [DynamicAmount.AggregateBattlefield], no printed base P/T, and it counts
 * *artifacts* — the Master itself included, since it is an artifact on the battlefield. The lord is
 * an ordinary layer-7c static: [ModifyStats] over a [GroupFilter] of
 * `GameObjectFilter.ArtifactCreature.youControl()` with `excludeSelf = true` for the printed
 * "other", so the Master never pumps itself on top of its own CDA.
