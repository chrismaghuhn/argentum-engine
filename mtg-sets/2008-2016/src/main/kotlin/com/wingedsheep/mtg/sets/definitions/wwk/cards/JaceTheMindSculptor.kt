/**
 * Jace, the Mind Sculptor
 * {2}{U}{U}
 * Legendary Planeswalker — Jace
 * Starting Loyalty: 3
 *
 * +2: Look at the top card of target player's library. You may put that card on the bottom of that
 *     player's library.
 * 0: Draw three cards, then put two cards from your hand on top of your library in any order.
 * −1: Return target creature to its owner's hand.
 * −12: Exile all cards from target player's library, then that player shuffles their hand into
 *      their library.
 *
 * Three of the four abilities reach into a *targeted* player's zones rather than the controller's,
 * so every zone reference in them is [Player.ContextPlayer] `(0)` — the target bound by
 * `target("target player", Targets.Player)` — and only the look itself stays with the controller
 * (the default [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.effects.LookAudience.Controller] on `gather`).
 *
 * The 0 is Brainstorm's shape verbatim (draw then Gather → Select → Move over hand), and for the
 * same reason: one atomic resolution, no priority window between the draw and the put-back
 * (2020-08-07 ruling).
 *
 * The −12's put-back is one [ZonePlacement.Shuffled] move of the whole hand. An empty hand gathers
 * nothing, so the move is a no-op and no shuffle happens — the second 2020-08-07 ruling, where the
 * target's library stays empty and they lose only on their next draw.
