 * Creature — Human Monk
 * 3 / 3
 *
 * Whenever you cast a noncreature spell, creatures you control get +1/+1 until end of turn.
 *
 * A team pump rather than a self pump, so this is not prowess — a plain
 * `Triggers.you.casts(GameObjectFilter.Noncreature)` trigger over [Patterns.Group.modifyStatsForAll], which iterates the
 * group and applies the +1/+1 per creature (the source included; the printed noun is "creatures you
 * control", not "other creatures"). The `Duration.EndOfTurn` default spells "until end of turn".
