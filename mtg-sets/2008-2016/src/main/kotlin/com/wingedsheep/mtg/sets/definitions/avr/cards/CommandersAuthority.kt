/**
 * Commander's Authority
 * {4}{W}
 * Enchantment — Aura
 *
 * Enchant creature
 * Enchanted creature has "At the beginning of your upkeep, create a 1/1 white Human creature token."
 *
 * The Cathar's Call shape. The quoted ability is granted *to* the enchanted creature through
 * [GrantTriggeredAbility] (whose filter defaults to the attached creature), and the trigger is
 * installed with `Triggers.you.beginningOf(Step.UPKEEP)`'s own event and binding passed through verbatim — ANY, not
 * ATTACHED. An ATTACHED-bound trigger is never indexed by the engine's trigger index, so keeping
 * the spec's binding is what makes the card do anything at all.
 *
 * Granting the ability to the creature also lands "your upkeep" and the token's controller on the
 * *creature's* controller rather than the Aura's, which is the printed reading: enchant an
 * opponent's creature and they get the Humans.
