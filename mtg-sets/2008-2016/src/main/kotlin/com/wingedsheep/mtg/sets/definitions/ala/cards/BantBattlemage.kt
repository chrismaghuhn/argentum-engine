/**
 * Bant Battlemage
 * {2}{W}
 * Creature — Human Wizard
 * 2 / 2
 * {G}, {T}: Target creature gains trample until end of turn.
 * {U}, {T}: Target creature gains flying until end of turn.
 *
 * Two independent activated abilities rather than one modal one — the printed card prices them
 * separately and each taps the Battlemage, so they can't both be used in a turn without an untapper.
 * Each cost is [Costs.Composite] of a coloured [Costs.Mana] and [Costs.Tap], and each effect is
 * [Effects.GrantKeyword] on the ability's own bound target, whose default `Duration.EndOfTurn` is
 * the printed "until end of turn". The off-colour activation costs are what put G and U into the
 * card's colour identity.
