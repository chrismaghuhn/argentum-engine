/**
 * Frostwind Invoker
 * {4}{U}
 * Creature — Merfolk Wizard
 * 3 / 3
 *
 * Flying
 * {8}: Creatures you control gain flying until end of turn.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *  - The invoker ability is a plain [activatedAbility] with a `{8}` mana cost — no tap symbol, no
 *    timing restriction — so it is repeatable and usable at instant speed.
 *  - "Creatures you control" is a **group**, not a target: [Effects.ForEachInGroup] over
 *    [GroupFilter.AllCreaturesYouControl] grants the keyword once per member, with
 *    [EffectTarget.IterationEntity] naming the current iteration entity. That matches Assay's `ForEach` over
 *    an `IterationSpace.Group` whose filter is `IsCreature` + `ControlledByYou`.
 *  - The group is evaluated on resolution, so creatures that arrive later this turn do not gain
 *    flying — which is what "creatures you control gain flying until end of turn" says (a one-shot
 *    grant, not a continuous "have flying" static).
 *  - [Effects.GrantKeyword] already defaults to an end-of-turn duration, so no explicit `duration`
 *    is written.
