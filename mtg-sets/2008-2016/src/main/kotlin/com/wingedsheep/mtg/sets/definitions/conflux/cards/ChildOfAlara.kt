/**
 * Child of Alara
 * {W}{U}{B}{R}{G}
 * Legendary Creature — Avatar
 * 6 / 6
 * Trample
 * When Child of Alara dies, destroy all nonland permanents. They can't be regenerated.
 *
 * The wrath is [Patterns.Group.destroyAllPipeline], not a per-permanent iteration: the group is
 * gathered once from the battlefield and moved as one collection, so every permanent leaves
 * simultaneously and none of them sees the others go. `noRegenerate = true` is the printed "they
 * can't be regenerated" — the flag rides on the collection move rather than needing its own
 * `CantBeRegenerated` shield per permanent. `Triggers.self.dies()` is the plain battlefield → graveyard
 * self-trigger; the sweep reads nothing off the dying Child, so no last-known information is
 * involved.
