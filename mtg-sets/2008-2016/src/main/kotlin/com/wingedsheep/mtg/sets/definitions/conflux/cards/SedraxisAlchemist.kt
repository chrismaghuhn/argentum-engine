/**
 * Sedraxis Alchemist
 * {2}{B}
 * Creature — Zombie Wizard
 * 2 / 2
 * When this creature enters, if you control a blue permanent, return target nonland permanent to its owner's hand.
 *
 * Conflux's "if you control a <colour> permanent" clause is an ordinary intervening-"if"
 * (CR 603.4): checked when the Alchemist enters and rechecked on resolution, so losing the last
 * blue permanent in response fizzles the bounce. [Conditions.YouControl] over
 * `Permanent.withColor(BLUE)` is the existential — the bare noun "permanent" is not narrowed to
 * creatures. The bounce is [Effects.ReturnToHand], which routes to the card's *owner's* hand on its
 * own, over the prebuilt [Targets.NonlandPermanent].
