/**
 * Necromaster Dragon
 * {3}{U}{B}
 * Creature — Dragon
 * 4 / 4
 *
 * Flying
 * Whenever this creature deals combat damage to a player, you may pay {2}. If you do, create a 2/2
 * black Zombie creature token and each opponent mills two cards.
 *
 * "You may pay {2}. If you do, …" is [Effects.MayPay] — one gate whose consequence runs only when
 * the mana is actually paid, rather than an `optional` trigger wrapped around a payment. The
 * consequence is a single sentence with two halves, so both live in one [Effects.Composite].
 *
 * The mill half says "each opponent", which is the *player* argument to the mill recipe and not a
 * loop around it: `Patterns.Library.mill(2, EffectTarget.PlayerRef(Player.EachOpponent))` gathers
 * and moves each opponent's top two in one pipeline. Wrapping it in a `ForEachPlayer` would say the
 * same thing twice.
