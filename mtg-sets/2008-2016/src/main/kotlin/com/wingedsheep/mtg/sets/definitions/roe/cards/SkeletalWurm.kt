/**
 * Skeletal Wurm
 * {7}{B}
 * Creature — Skeleton Wurm
 * 7 / 6
 *
 * {B}: Regenerate this creature.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *  - A plain mana-only activated ability: [Costs.Mana] for `{B}`, no tap symbol, so it can be
 *    activated repeatedly and at instant speed.
 *  - Regeneration has no `Effects.*` facade — `docs/card-sdk-language-reference.md` documents
 *    `RegenerateEffect(target)` as the raw shape ("raw — no facade"), and every regenerating
 *    creature in the corpus (Unworthy Dead, Sanguine Guard, Spined Fluke, Child of Gaea) constructs
 *    it directly. `EffectTarget.Self` is Assay's `{"type": "Self"}` target: the shield lands on this
 *    creature, not on a chosen one.
 *  - `Effects.CantBeRegenerated` / `Destroy(noRegenerate = true)` are the *opposite* side of this
 *    mechanic and are not involved here.
