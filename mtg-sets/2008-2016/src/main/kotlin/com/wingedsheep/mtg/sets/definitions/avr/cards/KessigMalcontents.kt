/**
 * Kessig Malcontents — Avacyn Restored #142
 * {2}{R} · Creature — Human Warrior · 3/1
 *
 * When this creature enters, it deals damage to target player or planeswalker equal to the number
 * of Humans you control.
 *
 * "Humans" is a bare tribal noun, so the count is over *permanents* with the subtype, not only
 * creatures — the Malcontents itself is one of them, since it is already on the battlefield when
 * the trigger resolves. The amount is read at resolution by
 * [DynamicAmounts.battlefield], so removal in response shrinks the damage.
