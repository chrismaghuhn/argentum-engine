/**
 * Soul's Attendant
 * {W}
 * Creature — Human Cleric
 * 1 / 1
 *
 * Whenever another creature enters, you may gain 1 life.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *  - The printed word is "**another** creature", so the binding is [TriggerBinding.OTHER] — Soul's
 *    Attendant entering does not trigger itself, but every other creature entering does. Assay
 *    compiles `"binding": "OTHER"` over a `ZoneChangeEvent` to the battlefield, and this matches it.
 *  - The card prints no "you control", so the filter is a bare [GameObjectFilter.Creature]: an
 *    opponent's creature entering triggers this just as one of yours does. This is why the trigger
 *    is spelled with `Triggers.self.matching(...).enters()` rather than `Triggers.another(GameObjectFilter.Creature.youControl()).enters()`,
 *    whose filter is scoped to your own side — the same choice Essence Warden documents.
 *  - "you **may** gain 1 life" is a consent gate on resolution, which is what the `optional = true`
 *    shorthand lowers to (`Gate.MayDecide` wrapping the effect — Assay's `Gated`/`Gate.MayDecide`).
 *    Soul Warden, the non-optional twin, is the card without this line.
