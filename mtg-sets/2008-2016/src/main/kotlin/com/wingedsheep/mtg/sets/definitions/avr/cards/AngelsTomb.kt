/**
 * Angel's Tomb
 * {3}
 * Artifact — Uncommon (AVR #211)
 *
 * "Whenever a creature you control enters, you may have this artifact become a 3/3 white Angel
 * artifact creature with flying until end of turn."
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 *  - The trigger uses [TriggerBinding.ANY] over "creature you control", not the `OtherCreatureEnters`
 *    sugar: the printed text is "a creature you control", with no "another" clause. The distinction
 *    is inert in practice (the Tomb is not a creature as it enters) but the ANY binding is what the
 *    text says.
 *  - [Effects.May] wraps the animation: the controller is asked each time the trigger resolves, and
 *    declining leaves the Tomb a plain artifact.
 *  - [Effects.BecomeCreature] always adds CREATURE, so `addTypes` carries the *other* word the
 *    text prints — ARTIFACT, a no-op union on a permanent that is already one. It sets base 3/3,
 *    the Angel subtype, white, and flying, all until end of turn. Animating an already-animated
 *    Tomb just layers a second identical effect — harmless.
