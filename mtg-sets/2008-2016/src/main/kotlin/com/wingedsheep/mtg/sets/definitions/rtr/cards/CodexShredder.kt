 * {5}, {T}, Sacrifice this artifact: Return target card from your graveyard to your hand.
 *
 * Canonical printing: Return to Ravnica, the card's earliest real printing.
 *
 * Two activated abilities. The mill is [Patterns.Library.mill] pointed at the bound player, which
 * lowers to the gather-then-move pipeline that marks the move as a mill (so mill-watchers see
 * it). The recursion targets a card in the *graveyard* zone, which is a zoned [TargetObject]
 * rather than a permanent target.
