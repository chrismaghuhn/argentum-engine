/**
 * Abbot of Keral Keep
 * {1}{R}
 * Creature — Human Monk
 * 2/1
 *
 * Prowess (Whenever you cast a noncreature spell, this creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn.)
 * When this creature enters, exile the top card of your library. Until end of turn, you may play that card.
 *
 * The ETB is the named "impulse draw" mechanic — [Patterns.Exile.impulse] gathers the top card,
 * moves the collection to exile and grants play permission expiring at end of turn. The card still
 * costs its mana, which is why this is `impulse` rather than the play-free variant.
