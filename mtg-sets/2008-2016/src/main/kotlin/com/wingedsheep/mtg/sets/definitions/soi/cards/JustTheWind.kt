/**
 * Just the Wind (Shadows over Innistrad #71)
 * {1}{U}
 * Instant
 *
 * Return target creature to its owner's hand.
 * Madness {U} (If you discard this card, discard it into exile. When you do, cast it for its madness cost or put it into your graveyard.)
 *
 * A plain bounce: [Effects.ReturnToHand] already sends the permanent to its *owner's* hand, so
 * stealing a creature and bouncing it doesn't keep the card. Madness (CR 702.35) is the reason
 * the spell reads as a one-mana trick — the cast happens while the madness trigger resolves.
