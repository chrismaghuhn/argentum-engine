/**
 * Resounding Thunder
 * {2}{R}
 * Instant
 * Resounding Thunder deals 3 damage to any target.
 * Cycling {5}{B}{R}{G} ({5}{B}{R}{G}, Discard this card: Draw a card.)
 * When you cycle this card, it deals 6 damage to any target.
 *
 * The red member of the Alara "Resounding" cycle, composed like the Onslaught cycling cycle: a
 * `spell { }` body, [KeywordAbility.cycling] for the wedge-coloured cycling cost, and a
 * `Triggers.self.isCycled()` triggered ability carrying the larger effect. Both halves are
 * [Effects.DealDamage] over a [Targets].`Any` requirement declared on their own ability, and the
 * damage source is left implicit so it resolves to the card itself. Unlike the Onslaught cycle there
 * is no printed "you may", so the trigger is not optional.
