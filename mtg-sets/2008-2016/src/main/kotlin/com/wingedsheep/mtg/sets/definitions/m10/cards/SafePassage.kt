/**
 * Safe Passage
 * {2}{W}
 * Instant
 *
 * Prevent all damage that would be dealt to you and creatures you control this turn.
 *
 * - A wider Fog: not combat-only and not source-restricted, so burn spells and ability damage are
 *   blanked for the rest of the turn too.
 * - [Effects.PreventDamage] with `toGroup` + `alsoToYou` is one recipient-group shield covering both halves —
 *   a player is not a permanent, so the "you and" rides along as
 *   [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.effects.PreventDamageEffect.recipientGroupIncludesController]
 *   rather than splitting into a second effect (Eerie Interference is the same shape, narrowed to
 *   creature sources).
 * - The group is re-evaluated against projected state at the moment damage would be dealt, so a
 *   creature that changes controller mid-turn is judged as it is then.
