 * The spell half is a plain [Effects.DealDamage] over one named target ([Targets.Creature]).
 * Basic landcycling is [KeywordAbility.basicLandcycling], which is the shared cycling machinery
 * with its search narrowed to *basic* land cards and its reminder text prefixed "Basic
 * landcycling" — it carries its own cost, so no `keywords(...)` entry belongs alongside it.
