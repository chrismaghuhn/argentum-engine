/**
 * Fortuitous Find

 * Sorcery
 *
 * Choose one or both —
 * • Return target artifact card from your graveyard to your hand.
 * • Return target creature card from your graveyard to your hand.
 *
 * "Choose one or both" is `modal(chooseCount = 2, minChooseCount = 1)` — `chooseCount` is the
 * ceiling and `minChooseCount` the floor (CR 700.2). Each mode carries its own target, so an
 * artifact creature card can satisfy either bullet but not both with the same card: the two
 * requirements are chosen at the same time and must name different objects.
