/**
 * Guard Duty
 * {W}
 * Enchantment — Aura
 *
 * Enchant creature
 * Enchanted creature has defender.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *  - "Enchant creature" is the Aura's attachment requirement, authored as
 *    `auraTarget = Targets.Creature` — an Aura with no `auraTarget` never attaches to anything.
 *  - The grant is a *static* ability (`GrantKeyword`), which projects in Layer 6 onto the
 *    attached creature. Its default scope is the enchanted creature, so no explicit filter is
 *    needed — the same shape as Zephyr Net, which grants defender and flying this way.
 *  - Nothing about the grant is conditional or timed, so no `Duration` and no condition: it lasts
 *    exactly as long as the Aura stays attached.
