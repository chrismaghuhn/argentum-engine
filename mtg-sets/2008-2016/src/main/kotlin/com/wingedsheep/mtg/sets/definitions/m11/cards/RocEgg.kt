/**
 * Roc Egg
 * {2}{W}
 * Creature — Bird Egg
 * 0/3
 *
 * Defender (This creature can't attack.)
 * When this creature dies, create a 3/3 white Bird creature token with flying.
 *
 * - `Triggers.self.dies()` is the battlefield-to-graveyard zone change bound to the source itself
 *   (CR 700.4), so the egg hatches whether it was destroyed, sacrificed, or died to lethal damage —
 *   but not when it is exiled or bounced.
 * - The reminder text for defender is printed on the card and kept verbatim in the oracle text.
