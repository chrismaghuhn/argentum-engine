/**
 * Godtoucher
 * {3}{G}
 * Creature — Elf Cleric
 * 2 / 2
 * {1}{W}, {T}: Prevent all damage that would be dealt to target creature with power 5 or greater this turn.
 *
 * The activated cost is a [Costs.Composite] of mana plus [Costs.Tap]. The power threshold rides the
 * target itself — [TargetFilter.Creature]`.powerAtLeast(5)` — so it is checked on announcement and
 * rechecked on resolution. The shield is [Effects.PreventDamage] with every other parameter at its
 * default: a null `amount` means "prevent all", non-combat damage is covered too,
 * `PreventionDirection.ToTarget` is the printed "dealt to", and `Duration.EndOfTurn` is "this turn".
