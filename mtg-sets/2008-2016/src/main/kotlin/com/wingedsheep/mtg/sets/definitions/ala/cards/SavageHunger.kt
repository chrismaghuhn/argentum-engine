 * Enchant creature
 * Enchanted creature gets +1/+0 and has trample.
 * Cycling {2} ({2}, Discard this card: Draw a card.)
 *
 * "Enchant creature" is the `auraTarget`, without which the Aura would have nothing to attach to.
 * The two granted characteristics are two statics whose `filter` defaults to
 * `GroupFilter.attachedCreature()` — [ModifyStats] for the pump and [GrantKeyword] for trample —
 * so each applies in its own layer to whatever the Aura is currently on. Cycling is the
 * [KeywordAbility.cycling] keyword ability, never a plain `Keyword` entry.
