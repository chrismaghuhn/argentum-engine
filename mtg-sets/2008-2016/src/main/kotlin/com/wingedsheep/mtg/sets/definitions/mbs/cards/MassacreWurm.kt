/**
 * Massacre Wurm
 * {3}{B}{B}{B}
 * Creature — Phyrexian Wurm
 * 6/5
 *
 * When this creature enters, creatures your opponents control get -2/-2 until end of turn.
 * Whenever a creature an opponent controls dies, that player loses 2 life.
 *
 *  - **ETB** — a per-creature -2/-2 floating effect over every creature an opponent controls at
 *    resolution ([Effects.ForEachInGroup] with the iterated creature as [EffectTarget.IterationEntity]).
 *    Creatures that enter later are unaffected; the set is fixed when the ability resolves.
 *  - **Death drain** — a `Triggers.<subject>.leaves(to, excludeTo, excludeSacrifice)`-to-graveyard trigger filtered to
 *    opponent-controlled creatures (fires once per death). [Player.TriggeringPlayer] resolves to
 *    the dying creature's controller, so "that player" loses 2 life.
 *
 * Canonical printing lives in Mirrodin Besieged (the card's earliest real printing); Foundations
 * contributes only a [com.wingedsheep.sdk.model.Printing] row.
