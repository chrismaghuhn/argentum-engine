/**
 * Harmless Assault
 * {2}{W}{W}
 * Instant
 *
 * Prevent all combat damage that would be dealt this turn by attacking creatures.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *  - A *source-side* shield, not a Fog: the printed line names no recipient, so the damage is
 *    silenced wherever it would land — attackers hitting the defending player, attackers trading
 *    with blockers, attackers hitting a planeswalker. That is `Effects.PreventCombatDamageFrom`,
 *    which is the unified `PreventDamageEffect` with `PreventionDirection.FromTarget` (no recipient
 *    clause) and a `PreventionSourceFilter.Matching` naming the eligible sources — exactly the
 *    shape Assay compiles this text to.
 *  - `PreventionScope.CombatOnly` is baked into that facade and is load-bearing here: the card says
 *    "combat damage", so an attacking creature's activated damage ability still resolves normally.
 *  - `GameObjectFilter.Creature.attacking()` names "creatures that are attacking". The filter
 *    is re-evaluated at the moment each damage instance would be dealt, so a creature that
 *    stops attacking (or one put onto the battlefield attacking after this resolves) is judged as
 *    it is when combat damage happens, which is what "attacking creatures" means.
