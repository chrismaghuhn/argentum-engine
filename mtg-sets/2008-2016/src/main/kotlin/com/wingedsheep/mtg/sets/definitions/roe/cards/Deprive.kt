/**
 * Deprive
 * {U}{U}
 * Instant
 *
 * As an additional cost to cast this spell, return a land you control to its owner's hand.
 * Counter target spell.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *  - The bounce is an **additional cost** (CR 601.2f), not an effect: it is paid as the spell is
 *    cast, so a controller with no land on the battlefield cannot cast Deprive at all, and the land
 *    still returns if the counter later fizzles because its target left the stack. That is
 *    `Costs.additional.ReturnToHand`, matching Assay's `AdditionalAtom` → `AtomReturnToHand`.
 *    The Disappearing Act / Familiar's Ruse shape, narrowed from a permanent to a land.
 *  - The filter is the bare [GameObjectFilter.Land]. `CostAtom.ReturnToHand` already scopes its
 *    candidates to permanents *you control*, which is exactly the printed "a land you control" —
 *    so no `.youControl()` is written here, the same as Disappearing Act. Assay's JSON likewise
 *    carries only the `IsLand` predicate.
 *  - "Counter target spell" is the plain [Effects.CounterSpell] over a [Targets.Spell] requirement
 *    — Assay's `TargetObject` with `zone: Stack` and no further predicates. `CounterEffect` reads
 *    the spell's single declared target itself, so the facade takes no handle.
