/**
 * Borderland Ranger — Magic 2010 #169
 * {2}{G} · Creature — Human Scout Ranger · 2/2
 *
 * When this creature enters, you may search your library for a basic land card, reveal it, put it
 * into your hand, then shuffle.
 *
 * `optional = true` lowers to the `Gate.MayDecide` the printed "you may" names, wrapping the
 * [Patterns.Library] gather → choose-up-to → move pipeline. `shuffleAfter` is the facade default
 * and supplies the printed "then shuffle"; failing to find is legal (CR 701.23b), which is why the
 * selection is a choose-*up-to*.
