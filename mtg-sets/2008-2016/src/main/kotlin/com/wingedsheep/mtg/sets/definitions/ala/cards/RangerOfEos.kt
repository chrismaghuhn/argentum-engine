/**
 * Ranger of Eos
 * {3}{W}
 * Creature — Human Soldier Ranger
 * 3 / 2
 * When this creature enters, you may search your library for up to two creature cards with mana value 1 or less, reveal them, put them into your hand, then shuffle.
 *
 * The whole printed search is one [Patterns.Library].`searchLibrary` call: the gather/select/move
 * pipeline, the trailing shuffle and the CR 701.23 "searched their library" event all come from its
 * defaults, with `count = 2` giving the "up to two" and `reveal = true` the reveal. The cap is a
 * filter predicate — `GameObjectFilter.Creature.manaValueAtMost(1)` — and `optional = true` lowers
 * the printed "you may" into a [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.effects.Gate.MayDecide] gate around it.
