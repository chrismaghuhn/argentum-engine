/**
 * Bloodrite Invoker
 * {2}{B}
 * Creature — Vampire Shaman
 * 3 / 1
 *
 * {8}: Target player loses 3 life and you gain 3 life.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *  - The level-up-less "invoker" cycle is a plain [activatedAbility] with a `{8}` mana cost and no
 *    tap symbol, so it can be activated repeatedly and at instant speed — [Costs.Mana] alone, no
 *    [Costs.Tap] and no timing restriction.
 *  - Two life clauses sharing one target slot, exactly as Absorb Vis: [Effects.LoseLife] aimed at
 *    the bound player, [Effects.GainLife] left on its default controller recipient. Only the loss
 *    is targeted — the gain says "you" — so a single [TargetPlayer] requirement is declared.
 *  - It is **target player**, not target opponent: the printed word allows you to point it at
 *    yourself, so [TargetPlayer] rather than `TargetOpponent`.
 *  - The two amounts are independent fixed 3s, not a linked drain: you gain 3 even if the target
 *    had less than 3 life to lose.
