/**
 * Branching Bolt
 * {1}{R}{G}
 * Instant
 * Choose one or both —
 * • Branching Bolt deals 3 damage to target creature with flying.
 * • Branching Bolt deals 3 damage to target creature without flying.
 *
 * "Choose one or both" is a *count*, not a third mode: `modal(chooseCount = 2, minChooseCount = 1)`
 * (CR 700.2). Each mode carries its own target, so picking both asks for two creatures and each
 * mode's legality is checked independently. The flying split is a predicate pair on the target
 * filters — `withKeyword(FLYING)` and `withoutKeyword(FLYING)` — which reads projected state, so a
 * creature that gains or loses flying in response changes which mode can still see it.
