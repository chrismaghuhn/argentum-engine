/**
 * Lupine Prototype
 * {2}
 * Artifact Creature — Wolf Construct
 * 5/5
 *
 * This creature can't attack or block unless a player has no cards in hand.
 *
 * "A player" is existential over every player, not just controller/opponent. `Exists(Player.Any,
 * Zone.HAND, negate = true)` is the WRONG shape for this — negating the whole existential yields "no
 * player among {Any} has a card" (all hands empty), not "some player's hand is empty". The correct
 * existential-over-players-satisfying-a-per-player-condition primitive is
 * `Compare(CountPlayersWith(Player.Each, Conditions.EmptyHand), GTE, Fixed(1))`: `CountPlayersWith`
 * rebinds `Player.You` inside its condition to each candidate player in turn (see
 * `DynamicAmountEvaluator.CountPlayersWith`), so `Conditions.EmptyHand` (itself `Exists(Player.You,
 * Zone.HAND, negate = true)`) is evaluated per-player and counted. `CantAttackUnless`/`CantBlockUnless`
 * route the condition through the standard `ConditionEvaluator`, so this composes unmodified at both
 * attack- and block-restriction checks.
