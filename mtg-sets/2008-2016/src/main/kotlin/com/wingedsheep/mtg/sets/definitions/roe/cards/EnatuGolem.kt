/**
 * Enatu Golem
 * {6}
 * Artifact Creature — Golem
 * 3 / 5
 *
 * When this creature dies, you gain 4 life.
 *
 * Modeling notes:
 *  - `Triggers.self.dies()` is precisely the battlefield → graveyard zone change Assay compiles this line
 *    to (`ZoneChangeEvent` from Battlefield to Graveyard) with the default `SELF` binding, so no
 *    filter and no binding override are needed.
 *  - No `triggerZone` override: on a dies trigger, setting `triggerZone = GRAVEYARD` *replaces* the
 *    default `{BATTLEFIELD}` active-zone set rather than adding to it, which stops the ability
 *    seeing the death at all. The rest of the corpus's dies-triggers (Guardian Automaton, Polluted
 *    Dead, Maalfeld Twins) all leave it alone, and so does this one.
 *  - "you gain 4 life" is the untargeted [Effects.GainLife], whose default recipient is already the
 *    ability's controller — writing `EffectTarget.Controller` here would restate a default.
