/**
 * Helvault
 * {3}
 * Legendary Artifact
 * {1}, {T}: Exile target creature you control.
 * {7}, {T}: Exile target creature you don't control.
 * When Helvault is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, return all cards exiled with it
 * to the battlefield under their owners' control.
 *
 * Both activated abilities exile their target linked to this permanent (accumulating in the
 * source's linked-exile pile). The leaves-to-graveyard trigger returns every card exiled with
 * Helvault at once under its owner's control — same linked-exile family as Oblivion Ring, but
 * the exile pile grows across repeated activations rather than holding a single card.
