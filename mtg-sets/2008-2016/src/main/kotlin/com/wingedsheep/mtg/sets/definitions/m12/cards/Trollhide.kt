/**
 * Trollhide
 * {2}{G}
 * Enchantment — Aura
 * Enchant creature
 * Enchanted creature gets +2 / +2 and has "{1}{G}: Regenerate this creature." (The next time the
 * creature would be destroyed this turn, instead tap it, remove it from combat, and heal all damage
 * on it.)
 *
 * Canonical printing: Magic 2012, the card's earliest printing. Reprinted in M14 as a `Printing`
 * row.
 *
 * The +2 / +2 is a static [ModifyStats] on the attached creature; the quoted ability is a
 * [GrantActivatedAbility] whose [EffectTarget.Self] resolves to the host creature (CR 113.7), so
 * "{1}{G}: Regenerate this creature" regenerates the enchanted creature (Lunarch Mantle). There is
 * no `Effects.Regenerate` facade — [RegenerateEffect] is the shipped spelling (Cudgel Troll).
