/**
 * Absorb Vis
 * {6}{B}
 * Sorcery
 * Target player loses 4 life and you gain 4 life.
 * Basic landcycling {1}{B}
 *
 * Two life clauses sharing one target slot: [Effects.LoseLife] aimed at the bound player and
 * [Effects.GainLife] left on its default controller recipient, joined by [Effects.Composite].
 * Only the loss is targeted — the gain names "you", so no second requirement is declared.
 *
 * "Basic landcycling" is [KeywordAbility.basicLandcycling], the typecycling machinery narrowed to
 * *basic* land cards (not merely lands carrying a basic land type), which is the `IsBasicLand`
 * search filter the printed reminder text spells out.
