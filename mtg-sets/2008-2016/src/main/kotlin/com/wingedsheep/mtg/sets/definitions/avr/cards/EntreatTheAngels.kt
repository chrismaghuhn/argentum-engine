 * Entreat the Angels

 * Create X 4/4 white Angel creature tokens with flying.
 * Miracle {X}{W}{W} (You may cast this card for its miracle cost when you draw it if it's the first card you drew this turn.)

 * The dynamic-count [Effects.CreateToken] overload with `count = DynamicAmount.XValue`: X is read
 * once at resolution (CR 613.4c) from whatever was announced — the `{X}{X}` of the printed cost, or
 * the single `{X}` of the miracle cost when cast that way. Token art resolves from the set's own
 * `tokenArt`, so no `imageUri` is authored here.
