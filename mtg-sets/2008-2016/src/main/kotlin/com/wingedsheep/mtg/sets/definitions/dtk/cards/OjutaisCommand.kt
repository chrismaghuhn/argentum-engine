/**
 * Ojutai's Command
 * {2}{W}{U}
 * Instant
 *
 * Choose two —
 * • Return target creature card with mana value 2 or less from your graveyard to the battlefield.
 * • You gain 4 life.
 * • Counter target creature spell.
 * • Draw a card.
 *
 * "Choose two —" over four modes is `modal(chooseCount = 2)`; two of the four target, so those two
 * declare their requirements inside their own `mode` block and the other two declare none.
 *
 * The reanimation mode keeps its `fromZone = GRAVEYARD` guard ([Effects.PutOntoBattlefieldFromGraveyard])
 * even though it targets — the asymmetry with the graveyard-to-*hand* return next door is
 * deliberate and empirical, and the facade's KDoc records why. The mana-value clause is a
 * refinement of the existing [TargetFilter.CreatureInYourGraveyard] rather than a hand-rolled
 * filter, which keeps the card-predicate order the same as every other "creature card with mana
 * value N or less" in the corpus.
 *
 * "Counter target creature spell" is [Effects.CounterSpell] over a stack-zone creature filter; the
 * effect itself carries no target because the requirement supplies it.
