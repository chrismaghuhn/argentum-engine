/**
 * Cunning Breezedancer
 * {4}{W}{U}
 * Creature — Dragon
 * 4 / 4
 *
 * Flying
 * Whenever you cast a noncreature spell, this creature gets +2/+2 until end of turn.
 *
 * A prowess-shaped trigger that is deliberately *not* prowess — the printed line is its own
 * ability with a +2/+2 bonus, so it is a plain `Triggers.you.casts(GameObjectFilter.Noncreature)` trigger. Writing
 * `prowess()` would lower to the keyword plus a second +1/+1 trigger and double-count the pump.
 * The pump is [EffectTarget.Self]; `Duration.EndOfTurn` is the facade default that spells
 * "until end of turn".
