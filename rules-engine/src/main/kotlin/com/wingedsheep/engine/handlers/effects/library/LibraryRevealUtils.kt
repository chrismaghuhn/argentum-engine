/**
 * Helpers for tracking which library cards a player is allowed to see.
 *
 * Reveals are stored as [RevealedToComponent] on the card entity. They persist while
 * the card is in a hidden zone (library/hand) and are cleared on shuffle so a freshly
 * shuffled library is once again opaque to the current client projection. This marker is not the
 * historical knowledge ledger: a shuffle invalidates tracked position/order there but may retain
 * identity/membership knowledge. Library position/order is recorded only by an explicit order-aware
 * producer.
