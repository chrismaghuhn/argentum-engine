/**
 * Tags mana added to a player's pool with its provenance — which source produced it and what
 * subtypes that source had — so payoffs can later ask "which kind of source produced the mana spent
 * to cast this?".
 *
 * The [ManaPoolComponent.manaBySubtype] / [ManaPoolComponent.manaBySource] counters record, per
 * subtype and per producing source, how many mana units in the pool came from there. When mana is
 * spent for a spell, [com.wingedsheep.engine.handlers.actions.spell.CastPaymentProcessor] consumes
 * from those counters proportional to the unrestricted mana taken from the pool and records what was
 * consumed on the spell (`SpentManaProvenance`).
 *
 * Generalizes the old Treasure-only counter (Treasure is now just `manaBySubtype[Subtype.TREASURE]`)
 * and powers Alchemist's Talent level 3 ("if mana from a Treasure was spent"), Bat Colony ("a Bat
 * for each mana from a Cave spent to cast it"), and the LCI mana-source lands (Tecutlan / Barracks /
 * Myriad Pools — "cast … using mana produced by this land"). The set of mana-producing executors
 * that call into here is: [AddManaExecutor], [AddColorlessManaExecutor], [AddManaOfChoiceExecutor]
 * (both the immediate and the post-color-choice resumer paths).
