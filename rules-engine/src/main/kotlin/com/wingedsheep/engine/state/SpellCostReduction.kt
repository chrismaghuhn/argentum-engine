/**
 * A duration-bounded "spells you cast [this turn | until your next turn] that match [spellFilter]
 * cost {[amount]} less to cast" discount, installed by
 * [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.effects.ReduceSpellCostsEffect] (Will, Scion of Peace;
 * Rowan, Scion of War; Ral, Leyline Prodigy).
 *
 * The repeating counterpart of [PendingNextSpellAffinity]: that rider is consumed by the first
 * matching spell, this one keeps applying until its [duration] ends. Two differences drive the
 * shape:
 *
 * - **[amount] is already resolved.** The Scion rulings fix X at the moment the activated ability
 *   resolves, so the executor evaluates the [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.values.DynamicAmount]
 *   once and stores the number. Re-reading it per cast would let life gained after activation
 *   inflate the discount.
 * - **It lives on the game state, not the source.** The ability has already resolved, so the
 *   discount must outlive the source leaving the battlefield.
 *
 * [Duration.EndOfTurn] entries are cleared at every turn boundary by
 * [com.wingedsheep.engine.core.TurnManager.startTurn]; [Duration.UntilYourNextTurn] entries survive
 * it and are removed after the untap step of [controllerId]'s next turn by
 * [com.wingedsheep.engine.core.CleanupPhaseManager.expireUntilYourNextTurnEffects].
 *
 * @property controllerId The player whose matching spells are discounted — and whose next turn
 *   ends an [Duration.UntilYourNextTurn] discount.
 * @property spellFilter Which of that player's spells the discount applies to.
 * @property amount Generic mana taken off each matching spell (CR 601.2f — colored mana is never
 *   reduced, and the mana component is floored at {0}).
 * @property sourceId The entity that created this discount.
 * @property sourceName Human-readable name of the source.
 * @property duration How long the discount lasts: [Duration.EndOfTurn] or
 *   [Duration.UntilYourNextTurn].
