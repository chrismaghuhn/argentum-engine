/**
 * The one place that decides whether an [ActivationRestriction] or a [CastRestriction] holds.
 *
 * Before this existed, the `when` over [ActivationRestriction] was written four times — in
 * `ActivateAbilityHandler`, in a private copy inside `ManaSolver`, in `CastPermissionUtils`, and
 * partly again in `ActivatedAbilityEnumerator` — and the one over [CastRestriction] twice
 * (`CastSpellHandler` and `CastPermissionUtils`). What the client was offered and what the server
 * accepted were separate implementations that only agreed by discipline. Now the handlers'
 * `validate`, the legal-action enumerators and the auto-tap solver all ask this kernel, so a new
 * restriction is one branch here and every path enforces it the same way.
 * `LegalityKernelBoundaryTest` keeps the dispatch from growing back anywhere else.
 *
 * Each check comes in two spellings over the same branch: a `…Failure` form returning the reason
 * shown to the player (handlers), and a Boolean form (enumerators, the solver).
 *
 * It also owns the linked-exile cast permission ([GrantMayCastFromLinkedExile]), which the cast
 * handler, the cast and land-play enumerators, and the client view each used to find for
 * themselves — the view from base control and printed abilities only.
