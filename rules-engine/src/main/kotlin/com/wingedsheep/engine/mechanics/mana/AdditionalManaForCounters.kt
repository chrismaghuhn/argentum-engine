/**
 * Finds the [AdditionalManaForEntryCounters] static (Chorus of the Conclave) that lets [casterId]
 * pay "any amount of mana" as an additional cost while casting a given card.
 *
 * Shared by the cast enumerator (to offer the choice), the cast handler (to validate and charge
 * it), so the two can't disagree about when the payment is legal. The ability works only while its
 * source is on the battlefield under the caster's control with its abilities intact (projected
 * controller, no ability loss), and only for a spell its filter matches — evaluated against the
 * card being cast.
