/**
 * 704.5b - If a player attempted to draw a card from a library with no cards in it since the last
 * time state-based actions were checked, that player loses the game.
 *
 * The draw only records the attempt ([AttemptedDrawFromEmptyLibraryComponent], CR 121.4); the loss
 * lands here, so a win granted later in the same resolution (CR 104.2b) ends the game first. The
 * marker is consumed on every check — an attempt excused by a "can't lose the game" grant
 * (Platinum Angel) is spent, not carried to the next check after the grant goes away.
