/**
 * CR 506.4 — "A permanent is removed from combat if … its controller changes …".
 *
 * Walks every creature with [AttackingComponent] or [BlockingComponent] and compares its
 * projected controller (which already reflects every Layer 2 control-changing effect, plus
 * Old Man of the Sea's post-Layer-7 power gate) to the player it should be fighting for:
 *
 * - Attackers must remain controlled by the *active team* — every player who could have
 *   declared an attacker this turn. A projected controller off that team → removed from combat.
 * - Blockers must remain controlled by the defending team. A projected controller that has
 *   joined the active team → removed from combat.
 *
 * Asked through [GameState.isActiveTurnFor], which is the team-aware form of
 * `controller == activePlayerId`: in Two-Headed Giant the attacking team declares one combined
 * attack (CR 805.10a), so both teammates' creatures are legitimately attacking even though the
 * engine names only one of them [GameState.activePlayerId] (CR 805.9). Comparing against that
 * single id swept the non-active teammate's entire attack out of combat on the next SBA pass.
 * Every format without shared team turns reduces to the plain equality, unchanged.
 *
 * Removal uses [CombatRemovalHelper] so dependent `BlockedComponent` / `BlockingComponent`
 * references stay consistent.
