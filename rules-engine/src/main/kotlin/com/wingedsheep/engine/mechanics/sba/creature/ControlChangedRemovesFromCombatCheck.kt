/**
 * CR 506.4 — "A permanent is removed from combat if … its controller changes …".
 *
 * Walks every creature with [AttackingComponent] or [BlockingComponent] and compares its
 * projected controller (which already reflects every Layer 2 control-changing effect, plus
 * Old Man of the Sea's post-Layer-7 power gate) to the player it should be fighting for:
 *
 * - Attackers must remain controlled by the active player (the only player who has
 *   declared attackers this turn). A projected controller that is no longer the active
 *   player → removed from combat.
 * - Blockers must remain controlled by a non-active player (the defender who declared
 *   them). A projected controller that has become the active player → removed from combat.
 *
 * The two-player approximation is sufficient for current scope; multi-player formats
 * can extend this once they're modelled. Removal uses [CombatRemovalHelper] so dependent
 * `BlockedComponent` / `BlockingComponent` references stay consistent.
