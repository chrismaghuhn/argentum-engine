/**
 * The battle card type (CR 310) in one place: its defense, its protector, and who may attack it.
 *
 * A battle is a permanent that is *attacked* rather than one that attacks. Three facts define it
 * and every consumer in the engine reads them through this object rather than re-deriving them:
 *
 *  - **Defense is counters.** A battle's defense is its number of defense counters (CR 310.4c); it
 *    enters with its printed defense number of them (CR 310.4b) and damage removes that many
 *    (CR 120.3h). [defenseOf].
 *  - **A protector, not a controller, defends it.** Every battle has a player designated as its
 *    protector (CR 310.9), and for a battle being attacked *that* player — not its controller — is
 *    the defending player for every rule and effect (CR 310.9d). [protectorOf].
 *  - **Its protector can never attack it.** Anyone for whom the protector is a defending player
 *    can, which for a Siege notably includes the battle's own controller (CR 310.9b).
 *    [canBeAttackedBy].
