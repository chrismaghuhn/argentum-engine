/**
 * "Could this creature be declared as an attacker right now?" — the per-creature half of the
 * declare-attackers legality check (CR 508.1a), asked outside the declare-attackers step.
 *
 * It runs the very same [defaultAttackRestrictionRules] list that [
 * com.wingedsheep.engine.mechanics.combat.AttackPhaseManager] enforces when attackers are actually
 * declared, so the two can never drift: if this says a creature can attack, declaring it would pass
 * the per-creature gate. It deliberately does *not* consider the per-defender rules
 * ([defaultAttackDefenderRules]) — those need a chosen defender, which doesn't exist yet.
 *
 * The caller is a cost enumerator: tapping a creature to pay Crew N / Saddle N / Teamwork N takes it
 * out of combat, because an attacker must be untapped. Surfacing this on each candidate lets the
 * client spend the creatures that weren't going to attack anyway.
