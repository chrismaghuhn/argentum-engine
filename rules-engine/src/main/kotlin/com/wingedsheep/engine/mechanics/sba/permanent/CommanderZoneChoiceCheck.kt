/**
 * CR 903.9a — if a commander is in a graveyard or in exile and that object
 * was put into that zone since the last time state-based actions were checked,
 * its owner may put it into the command zone. Hand/library moves are handled
 * before the physical transition by CR 903.9b.
 *
 * Implementation: when the format enables commanders, pause the SBA loop with a yes/no
 * decision the first time the SBA sees a given commander outside the command zone. In
 * [Format.alwaysDivertToCommand] mode the same choice is answered automatically, but only
 * after the commander has actually entered graveyard or exile. After
 * the prompt (yes or no) we attach [CommanderZoneChoiceAskedComponent] so the SBA does
 * not re-ask on the next iteration; [ZoneTransitionService.moveToZone] strips that marker
 * whenever the commander next changes zones, restoring the "fresh question on next entry"
 * semantics of "since the last time state-based actions were checked".
 *
 * Only one commander is asked about per SBA pass — APNAP-by-turn-order is preserved by the
 * outer loop in [com.wingedsheep.engine.mechanics.StateBasedActionChecker.checkAndApply].
