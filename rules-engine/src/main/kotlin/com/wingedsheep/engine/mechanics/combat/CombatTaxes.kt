/**
 * What a proposed attack or block costs in generic mana before it may be declared — Ghostly Prison,
 * Windborn Muse, Baird, Archangel of Tithes, Whipgrass Entangler.
 *
 * The tax is part of the *cost* of the declaration (CR 508.1a / 509.1a), so it is not only
 * [AttackPhaseManager]'s and [BlockPhaseManager]'s business: anyone deciding whether a declaration
 * is worth proposing — most importantly the AI, which otherwise proposes attacks it cannot pay for
 * and then has nothing to do with the payment prompt but decline it — has to be able to price one
 * first. Hence a public object rather than a private method on each phase manager (which is also
 * where the per-creature half of it used to live twice, verbatim).
 *
 * The tax is monotone in the declared set: dropping a creature never raises it. That is what lets a
 * caller trim an unaffordable declaration one creature at a time until it can pay.
