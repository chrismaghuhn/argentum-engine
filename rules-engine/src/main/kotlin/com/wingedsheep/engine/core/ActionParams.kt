/**
 * The choices an action needs that its ID alone can't carry.
 *
 * An action ID resolves to the [com.wingedsheep.engine.legalactions.LegalAction] the enumerator
 * produced, and for several action types that `GameAction` is a *template*, not a complete move:
 * `DeclareAttackers` is enumerated with an empty attacker map (the enumerator advertises the
 * candidates in `validAttackers` / `validAttackTargets` and leaves the choice to the player), and
 * the same is true of `DeclareBlockers`, of a spell's targets, and of X. Submitting such an action
 * with nothing attached is a legal move — it just means "attack with nobody", "block with nobody",
 * "no targets" — so a host that forgets to complete the template fails silently.
 *
 * These params are how any host that consumes legal-action templates (the Gym, an AI controller)
 * completes one. The completed action is then validated by the engine like any other: an illegal
 * attacker assignment is rejected rather than quietly dropped.
 *
 * Not expressible here, deliberately — each has its own channel:
 * - Complex decisions (target-selection pauses, damage assignment, ordering, …) → a
 *   [SubmitDecision] carrying a typed [DecisionResponse].
 * - Attacking bands (CR 702.22), alternative/additional cost payments, convoke/delve/improvise
 *   selections. A step carrying params for an action that can't use them is rejected with a
 *   message naming the action, never ignored.
 *
 * @property attackers attacker entity id → the player, planeswalker or battle it attacks.
 * @property blockers blocker entity id → the attackers it blocks, in order.
 * @property targets Targets for a cast/activation, in target-requirement order. Ids are resolved
 *   against the current state: a player id becomes a player target, an object on the stack a spell
 *   target, a battlefield permanent a permanent target, and a card in any other zone a card target.
 * @property xValue The value chosen for X.
