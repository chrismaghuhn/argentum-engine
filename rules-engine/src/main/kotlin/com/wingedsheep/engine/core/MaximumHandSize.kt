/**

 *
 * Used in two places that must agree: the cleanup step ([CleanupPhaseManager]), which discards down
 * to this value, and the client view ([com.wingedsheep.engine.view.ClientStateTransformer]), which
 * surfaces it so the player can see when an effect has changed their limit. Keeping one
 * implementation guarantees the badge the player reads matches the number cleanup enforces.
 *
 * Stateless — the caller supplies the evaluators so projection stays cached on the immutable
 * [GameState] (no evaluator allocation per call).

     * The effective maximum hand size for [playerId], or `null` when they have no maximum.
     *
     * Every effect that sets a player's maximum hand size or removes it is a rules-modifying
     * continuous effect, and CR 613.11 applies those in timestamp order — the latest one wins,
     * whichever kind it is. So with Spellbook ("no maximum hand size") entering before Twenty-Toed
     * Toad ("your maximum hand size is twenty"), the limit is twenty; the other way round, there is
     * none. The candidates are:
     *
     * - [SetMaximumHandSize] statics on the battlefield whose [SetMaximumHandSize.player] scope
     *   (resolved relative to the source's controller) includes [playerId]. A
     *   [ConditionalStaticAbility] wrapper is unwrapped and its condition evaluated against the
     *   source's controller, so "as long as …" gates (Winter's Delirium) are honored. A set effect
     *   can raise the limit above [DEFAULT] as readily as lower it (Doctor Octopus sets eight).
     * - [NoMaximumHandSize] statics on permanents [playerId] controls (Reliquary Tower).
     * - The rest-of-game [PlayerNoMaximumHandSizeComponent] (Wisdom of Ages).
     *
     * A static ability's effect takes its permanent's battlefield-entry timestamp (CR 613.7a).
     * With no candidate the limit is the CR 402.2 default of seven. Player-scoped rest-of-game
     * reductions (Inspired Idea) then apply to a finite limit, never below 0.
