/**
 * Result of executing a game action or engine step: the state it left, the events it emitted, and
 * its [outcome] — [Outcome.Done], [Outcome.Paused] on a player's question, or [Outcome.Rejected]
 * with a typed [Rejection].
 *
 * Nested engine steps also use `ExecutionResult` while composing an action and may have built
 * intermediate immutable states before reporting a rejection. [ActionProcessor] is the public
 * transaction boundary: a rejected action exposes the exact input state and retains only the
 * rejection, with no events or pending decision from the attempt.
 *
 * Game-over is signaled via `state.gameOver` + a [GameEndedEvent] in `events`.
