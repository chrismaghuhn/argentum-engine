/**
 * The connive keyword action as a *primitive* (CR 701.50): a named, replaceable, observable action
 * rather than a bare draw/discard pipeline. Card-level coverage of the one printed card that uses
 * it lives in `LeaderSuperGeniusScenarioTest`; this file exercises the mechanism with synthetic
 * cards so the two do not have to move together.
 *
 * Three properties are under test:
 *
 *  1. **Replacement (CR 614).** A [ModifyKeywordAction] over [EventPattern.ConnivedEvent] inserts
 *     its prefix effect *before* the connive, whatever the connive's source is. The prefix here
 *     gains life rather than drawing, so it can never be confused with connive's own draw, and
 *     asserting on life *while the discard decision is still pending* proves the ordering.
 *  2. **Scoping and stacking.** The `appliesTo` filter resolves "you" to the *replacement source's*
 *     controller, and two sources each apply once (CR 614.5 stops one source applying twice).
 *  3. **Observation (CR 701.50f).** A completed connive emits [PermanentConnivedEvent] and fires
 *     `ConnivedEvent` triggers — including when the draw and the discard were both impossible,
 *     which is what "even if some or all of those actions were impossible" buys.
 *
 * Plus the negative that keeps the primitive honest: a connive-*shaped* looting pipeline that the
 * printed card never calls connive (`Effects.ConniveTargeting`, the Teo, Spirited Glider shape) is
 * neither replaced nor observed.
