/**
 * The `HealOtherDamage` damage replacement as a *primitive* (CR 701.69a — heal): the damage is
 * dealt in full, and all damage marked before it is removed. Card-level coverage of the one printed
 * card that uses it lives in `WolverineFierceFighterScenarioTest`; this file exercises the mechanism
 * with synthetic cards so the two do not have to move together.
 *
 * The properties under test:
 *
 *  1. **Marked damage doesn't accumulate across damage events** — two separate burn spells leave
 *     only the second one's damage marked, on the `DamageUtils.dealDamageToTarget` path.
 *  2. **Once per damage event, not per instance** — all combat damage in a step is dealt
 *     simultaneously (CR 510.2), so a double-blocked healer keeps *both* blockers' damage and heals
 *     only what was marked before the step (the `CombatDamageManager` path).
 *  3. **The first-strike step is a separate event** — a first striker's damage is healed away by
 *     the regular combat damage step.
 *  4. **`appliesTo` is a real filter** — a `Recipient.CreatureYouControl` host heals *other*
 *     creatures its controller controls and leaves the opponent's alone, so the primitive is not
 *     hardwired to `Recipient.Self`.
 *  5. **Deathtouch still kills** — the heal clears the whole `DamageComponent` including its
 *     deathtouch flag, but the damage being dealt in the same event re-stamps it (CR 704.5h).
 *  6. **`damageType` is a real filter** — a `DamageType.NonCombat` host heals through burn but not
 *     through combat damage, so the type axis is honoured rather than ignored.
 *
 * Every accumulation assertion is paired with a control creature that has no replacement, so a
 * regression that stopped marking damage at all would fail rather than pass.
