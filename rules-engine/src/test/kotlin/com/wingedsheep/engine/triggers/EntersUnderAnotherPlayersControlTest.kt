/**
 * "Whenever another creature **you control** enters" must read the entering permanent's
 * *controller*, not its owner.
 *
 * Reanimation out of a graveyard under someone else's control (Virtue of Persistence,
 * Shark Shredder — `Effects.PutOntoBattlefieldUnderYourControl`) is the case where the two differ
 * while the permanent is on the battlefield: the card is still owned by the player whose graveyard
 * it came from, but the reanimator controls it. `ZoneChangeEvent` carries only `ownerId` (the
 * `lastKnown` snapshot is populated for battlefield *exits* only), so a controller predicate that
 * fell back to `ownerId` on an entry fired the owner's "creature you control enters" payoffs —
 * Virulent Emissary, Haliya Guided by Light, Essence Channeler downstream of them — off a creature
 * their opponent had just stolen out of their graveyard.
