/**
 * Tests for [MayPlayExpiry.WhileYouControlSource] — the "you may cast it for as long as you
 * control this [permanent]" window on a cast-from-exile permission (Taster of Wares).
 *
 * The `MayPlayExpiry` mirror of [Duration.WhileYouControlSource], and it must behave the same way:
 *
 *  - The window closes when the granting permanent leaves the battlefield **or** when its
 *    *projected* controller stops being the grant's controller — a Threaten-style steal of the
 *    source ends it just as a destroy does.
 *  - One-way per CR 611.2b. [com.wingedsheep.engine.mechanics.sba.permanent.EndedDurationExpiryCheck]
 *    physically removes the permission, so regaining control of the source does not revive it.
 *  - A window that is already over when the granting ability resolves never opens at all — the
 *    rule's own Master Thief example. No permission is created.
 *
 * Contrast [MayPlayExpiry.Permanent], which deliberately survives the source leaving play; the
 * last test pins that difference so the two can't silently converge.
