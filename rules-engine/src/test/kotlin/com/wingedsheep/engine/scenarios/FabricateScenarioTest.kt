/**
 * Mechanic-level tests for Fabricate N (CR 702.123).
 *
 * A fabricate card declares one keyword ability and nothing else; the engine supplies the whole
 * printed ability from [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.Fabricate] — a SELF enters-the-battlefield
 * trigger holding CR 702.123a's consent gate: "you may put N +1/+1 counters on it. If you don't,
 * create N 1/1 colorless Servo artifact creature tokens."
 *
 * The subjects are ad-hoc [card] definitions rather than a printed Kaladesh card, so the test pins
 * the *mechanic* and stays independent of which fabricate cards the corpus happens to hold.
 *
 * Five things worth pinning beyond the happy path:
 *  - the creature must actually **enter** for anything to happen (every case casts it);
 *  - the choice is made **as the trigger resolves**, not as it is put on the stack — the fabricate
 *    play pattern is deciding after the opponent has responded, so `answerFabricate` asserts
 *    nothing is asked before the resolution;
 *  - N comes from the printed keyword, so `Fabricate 3` scales both halves;
 *  - the decline half is a **colorless artifact** creature token, which the counters half must not
 *    create;
 *  - CR 702.123b — two printed instances trigger **separately**, with their own N each, rather than
 *    folding into a single fabricate of the summed N.
