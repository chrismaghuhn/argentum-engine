/**
 * The candidate domain of an "any player may [cost]" effect
 * ([com.wingedsheep.engine.handlers.effects.player.AnyPlayerMayPayExecutor], and the next-player
 * path in [com.wingedsheep.engine.handlers.continuations.SacrificeAndPayContinuationResumer]).
 *
 * Two properties, both broken before
 * [issue #1880](https://github.com/wingedsheep/argentum-engine/issues/1880):
 *
 * - the atom's own `excludeSelf` — and nothing else — decides whether the effect's source is a
 *   legal pick. The helper took a `sourceId` and ignored it, so a "sacrifice **another** creature"
 *   cost offered the source and reported a source-only board payable.
 * - both the initial prompt and the continuation read *projected* control. The continuation used a
 *   raw `ZoneKey(player, BATTLEFIELD)` scan, which is keyed by **ownership**, so a stolen creature
 *   was offered to its owner rather than to the player who actually controls it.
