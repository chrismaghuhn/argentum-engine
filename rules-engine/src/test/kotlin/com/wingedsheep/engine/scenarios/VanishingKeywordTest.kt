/**
 * Mechanic-level tests for Vanishing N (CR 702.62).
 *
 * A vanishing card declares one keyword ability; the engine supplies all three printed abilities
 * from [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.Vanishing] — the enters-with-N-time-counters replacement
 * (702.62a) at the entry seam, and the upkeep countdown (702.62b) plus the last-counter sacrifice
 * (702.62c) as keyword-derived triggers.
 *
 * Three things are worth pinning beyond the happy path:
 *  - the countdown is **yours**, not every upkeep;
 *  - the sacrifice fires on the removal that empties the counters **whatever removed them**, which
 *    is why 702.62b and 702.62c are two abilities here rather than suspend's single fused
 *    countdown;
 *  - the triggers are derived from the **projected** keyword, so a creature that merely *gains*
 *    vanishing counts down too.
