/**
 * Mechanic-level tests for Renown N (CR 702.112).
 *
 * A renown card declares one keyword ability; the engine supplies the printed triggered ability
 * from [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.Renown] — "When this creature deals combat damage to a
 * player, if it isn't renowned, put N +1/+1 counters on it and it becomes renowned"
 * (CR 702.112a) — the same keyword-expansion shape as vanishing, fabricate and flanking.
 *
 * The spec being pinned here, clause by clause:
 *  - **702.112a** — the trigger is *combat* damage dealt to a *player*, and it puts exactly N
 *    counters on.
 *  - **702.112a's intervening-`if`** — "if it isn't renowned" gates the trigger, so a creature that
 *    connects twice is renowned once and gets N counters, not 2N.
 *  - **702.112b** — renowned is a designation that lasts *until it leaves the battlefield*, is not
 *    an ability, and is not a copiable value.
 *  - **702.112c** — multiple instances trigger separately, but only the first to resolve does
 *    anything.
 *  - the projected-keyword gate — a creature that has lost all abilities has no renown trigger.
