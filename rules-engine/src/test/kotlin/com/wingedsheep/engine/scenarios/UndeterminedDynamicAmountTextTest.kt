/**
 * Regression for World War Hulk's chapter III rendering as "target gets +0/+0 until end of turn".
 *
 * An ability that pumps a creature by *its own* stats ("double its power and toughness") reads
 * [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.targets.EffectTarget.ContextTarget], so its amount is only knowable once
 * a target exists. Two surfaces render such an ability, and they sat on opposite sides of one bug:
 *
 *  1. **The targeting banner**, drawn *before* the player chooses. No target exists by construction,
 *     so `DynamicAmountEvaluator` couldn't resolve the reference and answered `0` — indistinguishable
 *     from a real zero, and rendered as a concrete "+0/+0". `evaluateForDisplay` now reports `null`
 *     there and the renderer falls back to the amount's own wording.
 *  2. **The ability on the stack**, where the target *is* locked in and the number is genuinely
 *     known. `ClientStateTransformer` never passed the ability's chosen targets into the context it
 *     rendered with — the spell path did — so this also read "+0/+0" when it should have read
 *     "+5/+5".
 *
 * The final assertion pins the text to reality: whatever the stack claimed is what the creature
 * actually becomes.
