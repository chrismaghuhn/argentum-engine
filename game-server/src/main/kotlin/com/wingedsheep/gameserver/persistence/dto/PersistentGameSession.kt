 * Deliberately *not* including the compact-replay recording, which it used to carry. Redis holds
 * live sessions with a TTL; replays are a durable artefact with a different lifetime and a different
 * consumer, and keeping a second copy here meant two stores that could disagree about what a game
 * was. The recording now lives only in [com.wingedsheep.gameserver.replay.ReplayStore], flushed
 * periodically while the game is in progress and resumed from there on restart — see
