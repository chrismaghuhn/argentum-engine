/**
 * The Case card mechanic (CR 719, Murders at Karlov Manor).
 *
 * A Case is an enchantment with two special abilities printed before a long dash (CR 719.3):
 *
 * ```
 * To solve — [condition]. (If unsolved, solve at the beginning of your end step.)
 * Solved — [ability text]
 * ```
 *
 * Both lower onto vocabulary the engine already has, which is why Cases add no new ability kind:
 *
 *  - **"To solve"** (CR 719.3a) is exactly "At the beginning of your end step, if [condition] and
 *    this Case is not solved, this Case becomes solved" — a triggered ability with an
 *    intervening-if. [toSolve] writes it.
 *  - **"Solved"** (CR 702.169) is not one ability shape but three, each with its own gate:
 *    a static ability applies "as long as this Case is solved" (702.169b), a triggered ability
 *    "triggers only if this Case is solved" (702.169c — a trigger restriction, so an ability that
 *    triggered while solved still resolves if the Case somehow stops being solved), and an
 *    activated ability may be activated "only if this Case is solved" (702.169d). The three
 *    `solved*Ability` helpers below are the ordinary ability builders with that gate pre-applied,
 *    so a Case author never hand-writes `Conditions.SourceIsSolved`.
 *
 * The solved designation itself (CR 719.3b) is engine state, not an ability and not a copiable
 * value: `Effects.BecomeSolved` stamps it, `Conditions.SourceIsSolved` / `StatePredicate.IsSolved`
 * read it, and it sticks until the permanent leaves the battlefield.
 *
 * A Case's remaining lines — the "When this Case enters" ability, or an always-on static like
 * Case of the Ransacked Lab's cost reduction — are plain `triggeredAbility { }` /
 * `staticAbility { }` blocks: they work whether or not the Case is solved.
 *
 * Example (Case of the Uneaten Feast):
 * ```
 * triggeredAbility {                                   // the unconditional first line
 *     trigger = Triggers.CreatureYouControlEnters
 *     effect = Effects.GainLife(1)
 * }
 * toSolve(Conditions.YouGainedLifeThisTurn(5))
 * solvedActivatedAbility {
 *     cost = AbilityCost.Atom(CostAtom.SacrificeSelf)
 *     effect = …
 * }
 * ```

/**
 * Add a Case's "To solve — [condition]" ability (CR 719.3a): "At the beginning of your end step,
 * if [condition] and this Case is not solved, this Case becomes solved."
 *
 * Both halves of that intervening-if matter and both are checked twice (CR 603.4) — when the
 * trigger would go on the stack and again as it resolves. The `not solved` half is what keeps a
 * solved Case from re-triggering every end step; the [condition] half is what makes a Case that
 * met its condition at end of turn but had it undone before resolution stay unsolved.
