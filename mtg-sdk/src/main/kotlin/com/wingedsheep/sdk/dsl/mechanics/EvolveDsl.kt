 * enters, if that creature's power is greater than this creature's power and/or that creature's
 * toughness is greater than this creature's toughness, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature."
 *
 * The "if" is an intervening-if (CR 603.4), checked when the creature enters and again on
 * resolution. Both sides are [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.values.DynamicAmount.EntityProperty]
 * value reads — projected power/toughness while the object is on the battlefield, last-known
 * information once it has left — so an entering creature that dies in response still evolves the
 * source off its last-known P/T, as the Gatecrash rulings require. The comparison is P against P
 * and T against T only; a 1/5 entering beside a 3/3 evolves it, a 2/2 entering beside a 3/1 does
 * too. The evolving creature's own entry never qualifies (it can't be greater than itself).
 *
 * Standalone so a token that intrinsically has evolve can carry the same ability; each instance is
 * a separate `TriggeredAbility`, so multiple instances trigger separately (CR 702.100d).
