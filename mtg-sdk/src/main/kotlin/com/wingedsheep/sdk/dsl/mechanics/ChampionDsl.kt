/**
 * Add Champion (CR 702.72, Lorwyn) — keyword + the pair of linked triggered abilities.
 *
 * > **CR 702.72a** — "Champion represents two triggered abilities. 'Champion an [object]' means
 * > 'When this permanent enters, sacrifice it unless you exile another [object] you control' and
 * > 'When this permanent leaves the battlefield, return the exiled card to the battlefield under
 * > its owner's control.'"
 * > **CR 702.72b / 607.2k** — the two abilities are linked; the second returns only what the first
 * > exiled.
 * > **CR 702.72c** — a permanent is "championed" by another permanent if the latter exiles the
 * > former as the direct result of a champion ability.
 *
 * The keyword is display-only; the behavior composes existing primitives, with no new executor:
 *
 *  - **Enters.** A Gather → Select → Move pipeline. `champion` says "exile another [object] you
 *    control" with no "target", so the permanent is **chosen, not targeted** — gathered with
 *    [CardSource.BattlefieldMatching] scoped to [Player.You] (projected control, so a permanent
 *    you stole this turn is eligible and one you lost is not) and to
 *    `GameObjectFilter.notSourceItself()` for "another". `notSourceItself` is *visit-aware*: it
 *    compares the resolving ability's originating battlefield visit, so a champion that blinked
 *    cannot exclude — or exile — the wrong instance of itself.
 *    [SelectionMode.ChooseUpTo]`(1)` is the "unless": picking nothing is always legal, and is the
 *    only option when you control no other matching permanent (the selection resolves without a
 *    prompt over an empty candidate set). The move carries `linkToSource`, which files the card in
 *    the *originating visit's* linked-exile pile.
 *  - **The "unless".** An [Effects.IfYouDo] gate over that pipeline whose criterion is
 *    [SuccessCriterion.CollectionNonEmpty] on the move's `storeMovedAs` ([CHAMPIONED_CARDS]) — the
 *    cards that actually reached exile, not merely the ones picked. Its `otherwise` is
 *    [SacrificeSelfEffect]; its `then` is [EmitChampionedEventEffect], the CR 702.72c signal that
 *    drives Mistbind Clique's "when a Faerie is championed with this creature".
 *  - **Leaves.** An ordinary `Triggers.self.leaves()` trigger running
 *    [Effects.ReturnLinkedExileUnderOwnersControl], which reads the same originating visit's pile.
 *
 * Modelling this as **two separate triggers** rather than an "exile until this leaves" replacement
 * is what CR 702.72a says and reproduces the printed interaction Fiend Hunter documents: if the
 * champion leaves the battlefield before its enters trigger resolves, the leaves trigger resolves
 * first against an empty pile and does nothing, and the enters trigger then exiles a permanent that
 * never comes back. It also means the sacrifice is a genuine no-op when the champion is already
 * gone, exactly as the printed instruction behaves.
 *
 * Multiple instances would install two independent pairs; no printed card has two, and because both
 * halves would share one linked-exile pile per battlefield visit, a card that needs two would have
 * to distinguish the pairs first (CR 607.2k links each pair separately).
 *
 * @param quality The [object] to champion, as a filter over **permanents** — champion's printed
 *   quality is a bare tribal noun ("a Goblin"), which per CR 109.2 reads as a Goblin *permanent*,
 *   so a Kindred noncreature Goblin is a legal choice. Use the [Subtype] overload for those; pass
 *   `GameObjectFilter.Creature` for "champion a creature".
 * @param qualityDescription The quality with its article, as printed ("a Goblin", "a creature").
