/**
 * Fabricate N (CR 702.123) as pure data — the enters-the-battlefield ability every fabricate
 * permanent has and none of them prints as a separate line.
 *
 * A card carrying `Fabricate 2` shows one keyword line plus its reminder text; the rules give it
 * one triggered ability, which CR 702.123a spells as a consent gate:
 *
 * > "Fabricate N" means "When this permanent enters, you may put N +1/+1 counters on it. If you
 * > don't, create N 1/1 colorless Servo artifact creature tokens."
 *
 * So [etbChoice] is a [Effects.May] with an `otherwise` — the shape [TriggeredAbility.effect]'s own
 * documentation names for a printed "you may … If you don't, …" — and **not** a
 * [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.effects.ModalEffect]. The reminder line's "put two +1/+1 counters
 * on it **or** create two Servos" reads like a modal, and the two would perform identically once
 * resolved, but they are decided at different *times*: a top-level `ModalEffect` on a triggered
 * ability is a modal ability, and CR 603.3c has its controller lock the mode in as the ability is
 * **put onto the stack**. Fabricate is not modal — its choice is made on **resolution**, which is
 * exactly the fabricate play pattern the timing exists for: the opponent kills the creature in
 * response to the trigger, and only then do you decide to take Servos instead of counters. A
 * gate's decision runs at resolution (CR 608.2c), so that works.
 *
 * Unlike vanishing's N-free triggers ([Vanishing.upkeepCountdown]), fabricate's single trigger
 * *carries* N, so [etbChoice] is a factory rather than a singleton. And unlike vanishing, whose
 * multiple instances stack into one pile of time counters (CR 702.62d), **CR 702.123b makes each
 * instance of fabricate trigger separately** — so [printedCounts] returns one N per printed
 * instance and the engine builds one trigger each, rather than summing. A permanent with
 * fabricate 1 and fabricate 2 gets two independent decisions, not a single fabricate 3.
 *
 * The keyword is one of the "read N off the printed [KeywordAbility.Numeric]" family: the engine
 * gates the derivation on the *projected* keyword (so a "loses all abilities" effect strips it) but
 * reads N from the printed keyword ability, because a projected keyword set carries no parameter.
 * No corpus card, token, or effect grants fabricate to something that doesn't print it, so the two
 * sources never disagree today; if one ever does, a *granted* fabricate has no N to read and
 * derives nothing — the same limitation vanishing's granted case has for its entry counters.
