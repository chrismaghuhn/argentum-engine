/**
 * Renown N (CR 702.112) as pure data — the triggered ability every renown creature has and none of
 * them prints as a separate line.
 *
 * A card carrying `Renown 1` shows one keyword line plus its reminder text; CR 702.112a gives it
 * one triggered ability:
 *
 * > "Renown N" means "When this creature deals combat damage to a player, if it isn't renowned,
 * > put N +1/+1 counters on it and it becomes renowned."
 *
 * Three details of that sentence are load-bearing and each maps to one part of
 * [combatDamageTrigger]:
 *
 *  - **"if it isn't renowned" is an intervening-`if`**, not a resolution-time check. CR 603.4 has
 *    it tested both as the ability would trigger and again as it resolves, which is exactly what
 *    CR 702.112c relies on: a creature with two instances of renown puts *two* abilities on the
 *    stack, the first to resolve makes it renowned, and the second then does nothing because its
 *    intervening-`if` no longer holds. Modelling the check as a
 *    [com.wingedsheep.sdk.dsl.Effects.If] inside the effect would get the
 *    same end result for the common case but would let the ability trigger at all while renowned,
 *    which the rules do not.
 *  - **The counters and the designation are one effect**, applied in printed order — the counters
 *    first, then [BecomeRenownedEffect]. Reversing them would make the second instance's
 *    intervening-`if` fail *before* the first instance's counters landed.
 *  - **"renowned" is a designation, not an ability and not a copiable value** (CR 702.112b). It
 *    lives in the engine's `RenownedComponent`, is read back through
 *    [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.predicates.StatePredicate.IsRenowned], and lasts until the
 *    permanent leaves the battlefield — a copy of a renowned creature is not itself renowned.
 *
 * The keyword is one of the "read N off the printed [KeywordAbility.Numeric]" family, the same
 * shape as [Vanishing] and [Fabricate]: the engine gates the derivation on the *projected* keyword
 * — so a creature that has lost all abilities stops being renowned-eligible — but reads N from the
 * printed keyword ability, because a projected keyword set carries no parameter. A *granted*
 * renown (Aragorn, Hornburg Hero: "Attacking creatures you control have first strike and renown
 * 1") therefore derives nothing today; unblocking it means giving projection a place to carry a
 * numeric keyword's N, which is a change to the projection model rather than to this object.
