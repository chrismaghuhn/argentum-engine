// recompiles and retests everything from cold. When GRADLE_BUILD_CACHE_DIR is set (see .github/workflows/ci.yml),
// we point the build cache at a workspace path that ci.yml caches with a prefix-matched actions/cache key,
// giving real cross-commit reuse. Unset locally, so developer builds keep the default Gradle user-home cache.

// oldest-to-newest: a new release year appends a module, and no set ever moves between them.

// lives. Engine tests (not about a specific card) stay in `:rules-engine`'s own suite.
