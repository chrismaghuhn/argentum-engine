# Ravnica completion work

Branch: `worktree-rav-completion`. Baseline: `4f09fec7e2`. Draft PR: #2236.

The goal is all 291 cards, their required engine functionality, and full set verification.
The initial source inventory was 239/291; the current inventory is **291/291** — every card is implemented; full-set verification (`verify-set`) remains.
The checklist is an inventory, not proof of rules correctness. Existing generated definitions
also need field and behavior review before completion can be claimed.

## Implemented in this branch

- A compositional `transmute(cost)` helper using hand activation, discard-self, sorcery timing,
  exact mana-value search, reveal, and shuffle. The helper reads the declared card mana cost
  when authored; declare `manaCost` before calling it.
- Drift of Phantasms, Dimir Infiltrator, Dizzy Spell, Muddle the Mixture, Dimir House Guard,
  Ethereal Usher, and Brainspoil, each with its own scenario file.
- Dimir Infiltrator's required Planechase 2012 printing row.
- `Effects.Regenerate(target)`, a facade over the existing regeneration effect.
- A regression fixes transmute after the discarded card is reanimated and copied in response:
  the search retains the discarded card's mana value, not the new permanent's characteristics.
- Dredge N uses the shared draw-replacement pipeline with intrinsic graveyard sources.
  The source is offered only when its owner can mill the full number; milling and returning
  compose existing effects. Numeric keyword serialization and the mtgish emitter are covered.
- Darkblast, Greater Mossdog, Grave-Shell Scarab, Moldervine Cloak, and Shambling Shell,
  each with a separate scenario file.
- Optional draw continuations preserve remaining draws through nested decisions and retain
  prior declines through pauses and saved-game reloads. A live client check exposed repeated
  offers after multiple declines; the regression now covers three dredgers and the next draw.
- Golgari Thug, Life from the Loam, Nightmare Void, and Stinkweed Imp compose existing
  primitives. Seventeen scenarios cover dredge, Thug targeting itself after death, Loam
  choosing zero through three lands and losing one target, caster-controlled discard,
  and Imp combat versus noncombat damage.
- Backlog bootstrap recognizes `basicLand(...)`, matching the authoritative card inventory.

## Current verification

- Latest four-card unit: `just build` passed (5m 30s), all 17 focused scenarios passed,
  fresh Scryfall fields/art and canonical-printing checks passed. Snapshots added exactly
  these four cards and changed no existing entry. Assay compared 103 with no divergences.

- `just test`: passed after dredge and both continuation regressions (7m 34s).
  An earlier dashboard timeout passed on focused rerun and in this final full run.
- Dredge: 14 engine scenarios, 10 scenarios across five separate card files, two SDK
  serialization tests, and two emitter tests passed. The final singular prompt wording
  was checked by rerunning the 14 engine scenarios and both browser regressions.
- Transmute: 27 scenarios across seven separate card files passed in the preceding unit;
  `just build` passed there and the full test gate above includes them again.
- Canonical-printing checks, fresh Scryfall fields, and HTTP 200 art checks passed for all
  seventeen added cards. Snapshot changes contain only the intended additions/corrections.
- `just assay-differential --set RAV`: no divergences among 103 compared cards. Assay
  declines transmute and dredge, so it does not independently verify these abilities.
- Client typecheck passed. Live client inspection and two headless Chrome regressions
  cover accepting dredge after multiple declines and declining all sources to draw normally.
  Manual scenarios are available for both transmute and dredge. Transmute has not had a
  browser playthrough yet; full-set self-play and verification remain outstanding.
- Backlog headers are in sync. Known baseline issue: 78 pre-existing unchecked entries
  across four Bloomburrow Commander backlog files. The user authorized continuing and
  disclosing this unrelated failure. Those files are untouched.

## Brownscale unit

Golgari Brownscale adds self-bound graveyard-to-hand trigger detection using the moving card,
without scanning hands. Six scenarios cover dredge, ordinary return, owner-controlled life gain,
unrelated zone changes, and a return followed by discard in one resolution firing exactly once.
Fresh Scryfall fields, art, printing placement, and the single-card snapshot change are verified.

`just test` passed (3m 13s). An earlier unrelated Abattoir Ghoul timeout passed in this resumed
full gate after the user authorized continuation. All three headless Chrome dredge regressions
passed, including acknowledging Brownscale's public return and resolving its life-gain trigger.
Assay compared 103 cards with no divergences; it declines Brownscale's full text.

## Remaining work

- ~~Finish the two remaining dredge cards~~ — done. Golgari Grave-Troll and Necroplasm both compose
  existing primitives (`EntersWithDynamicCounters` over a graveyard count, `Effects.Regenerate` behind a
  `RemoveCounterFromSelf` cost, and a `manaValueEqualsDynamic` destroy filter reading the source's counter
  count). Blood Funnel shipped in the same unit as a `PayOrSufferEffect` punisher. Sixteen scenarios cover
  them; Necroplasm's C16 reprint row was added. Dredge is now complete for the set.
- Finish the two remaining transmute cards: Clutch of the Undercity and Perplex. Dimir
  Machinations, Grozoth, Netherborn Phalanx, and Shred Memory shipped separately.
- Complete the other card-specific investigations in `mechanics.md` and all unchecked cards.
- Verify client interactions for new capabilities, and run the appropriate engine/server/client gates.
- Run the verify-set workflow over every card, printing, and token-art mapping; include self-play.
- Keep the PR in draft for review; merging is not authorized by this work plan.
