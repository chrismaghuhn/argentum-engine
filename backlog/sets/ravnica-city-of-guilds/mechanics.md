# Ravnica: City of Guilds (RAV) — Mechanics

Source inventory at baseline `4f09fec7e2`, with in-progress implementation noted below.
Support here means existing vocabulary, not a completed behavioral audit of every listed card.

A box is ticked when the engine already models the mechanic (an SDK primitive exists and a card in the corpus uses it). An unticked box is missing or unverified functionality; composition must be tried before adding engine types.

### - [x] Mill (19 cards)

Pay mana and discard this card from hand, at sorcery timing, to search for and reveal a card of the same mana value, put it in hand, and shuffle.

Replace a draw by milling the specified number of cards and returning this graveyard card to hand; require enough cards in the library.

**Engine support:** `KeywordAbility.dredge(N)` uses intrinsic graveyard sources in the shared draw-replacement pipeline. Sufficient-library checks, sequential draws, nested decisions, repeated declines, and saved-game reloads are covered.
