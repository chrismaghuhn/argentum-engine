# Reality Fracture (FRA) — Mechanics

Reviewed against all 285 unique cards in the Scryfall import on 2026-09-21, including prepare spell faces. This is an implementation map, not a claim that any FRA card is playable.

A checked box means the shared mechanic has existing SDK vocabulary and corpus examples. It does **not** certify every listed card’s full script. Unchecked sections identify shared missing behavior or combinations requiring focused engine verification before authoring those cards. Named and unnamed mechanics are ordered by card count; lists include all matches in this import, including reminder text and granted abilities.

Sources: [Scryfall FRA](https://scryfall.com/sets/fra), [SDK language reference](../../../docs/card-sdk-language-reference.md), SDK declarations and existing card definitions. Rule references were checked against the September 25, 2026 Comprehensive Rules linked by the [official rules page](https://magic.wizards.com/en/rules); that linked edition is dated after this review and includes FRA’s rules.

Scryfall currently marks all 461 printings as `booster: false`, yielding 0 draft cards and 285 extras. Preserve the tooling’s partition, but refresh the import when booster metadata changes. FRA has all five basic land names, so it needs no other set’s basic-land fallback. It is an expansion; leave sealed support at its normal default and retain `incomplete = true`.

**Engine support:** `Effects.Proliferate`. Tam’s repetition count needs distinct planeswalker-subtype aggregation; see investigations.

Cards: Tam, the Possibility

## Focused card investigations

These are review targets, not declarations that new effect types are necessary. Prefer existing compositions and add behavioral tests for any new engine vocabulary.

- **Samut, Tyrant of Naktamun:** split second and granting it to controlled instant/sorcery spells are absent from the keyword vocabulary.
- **Sanctum Lurker:** done — `GrantKeyword(AbilityFlag.SURVIVES_ZERO_LOYALTY.name, …)` exempts planeswalkers from CR 704.5i; the +2 is a `grantedLoyaltyAbility`.
- **Loot, the Anomaly:** treating negative power as positive for combat damage. **Loot, the Nexus:** distinct-power aggregation already exists; use it rather than adding another amount type.
- **Ruric Thar, Magecrusher:** lifetime history of combat damage, including damage to nonplayers. A damage-to-player predicate is insufficient.
- **Ruric Thar, Biomagus:** two independent prowess instances must survive representation and both trigger.
- **Inspired Tethermage:** count loyalty counters placed, with correct event grouping. **Jace, Reality Sculptor:** total loyalty of filtered permanents as an activation gate.
- **Tam, the Possibility:** distinct projected planeswalker types determine how often to proliferate.
- **Heartwood Crafter:** mana restriction excludes spells cast from hand, rather than excluding spells generally.
- **Warrior’s Blades:** equip reduction depends on counters on the chosen equip target.
- **Tomik, Orzhov Lawmage:** attacker cap per planeswalker. **Yuriko, Blade of the Mighty:** combat-wide spell and nonmana activation restrictions.
- **Uldaros Theorix:** distinct card types across selected targets and copied-card casting under a shared mana-value budget.
- **Violent Echoes:** carry numerical excess damage to the subsequent empower instruction.
- **Cruel Calculations:** number of cards each player milled this turn. **Draconic Visitor:** replace tokens with the prescribed token template.
- **Emrakul, the Exigent Doom:** duration tied to casting the specific exiled card. **Hall of Echoes:** temporary legend-rule exception.
- **Lich’s Relic** and **Primal Witchstalker:** reflexive triggers select their targets after the preceding choice, not on the original enters trigger.
- **Omnipresence:** dynamically restricted free casting; check the complete permission path.

## Suggested implementation order

1. FRA now has all five basic land types (25 artwork variants) and the five allied slowland reprints (10 printing records). Add the remaining reprints using their earliest canonical definitions. Scryfall still marks these basic-land variants outside boosters, so their limited-deckbuilding availability remains disabled pending corrected metadata.
2. Run `just assay-ready FRA` to identify cards that compose existing vocabulary. Implement and verify those in small related batches.
3. ~~Build Empower Jace~~ — done (`Patterns.Mechanic.empowerJace`).
4. Extend loyalty activation events/history and permissions, then author their payoffs. Address the focused investigations in separate mechanic-sized changes.

Use current Scryfall data for canonical printing placement, metadata and rulings when implementing each card. Neither this map nor a checked mechanic replaces the Assay differential gate or behavioral tests.
